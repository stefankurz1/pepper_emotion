Using Flow Control boxes
========================

| Here is an example of the use of 2 **Flow Control** boxes: **For** and **Wait For Signals**.
| **Flow Control** boxes are very useful when you want to create more complex behaviors.

*Create the following behavior*: while introducing himself, |roboN| nods two times,
then when both are done, |roboN| starts to wave.

=====  =================================================================================
Step       Action
=====  =================================================================================
1.     Drag and drop a **Audio**> **Voice** > **Say** box.

       Write |roboN|'s introduction sentence (*e.g.* "Hello I am |roboN| the little
       robot and I am ready to serve you, master!")

       Connect its input to the main input of the behavior.

       For further details, see:
       :ref:`choregraphe-howto-make-nao-say-something`.

2.     Create a new **Timeline** box, call it "Nod".

       Create a simple nodding movement behavior with its
       Motion Timeline.

       Connect its input to the main input of the behavior.

       For further details, see:
       :ref:`choregraphe-howto-create-timeline-box` and
       :ref:`Tutorial about movements<movements-tuto>`.

Test   If you use a real robot, you have to stiffen
       your robot first.

       For further details, see:
       :ref:`choregraphe-howto-enslave`.

       Click the |play-button| **Play** button: |roboN| nods once
       and introduces himself.

3.     Add a **Flow Control** > **For** box to your behavior.

       Set its **Final value** parameter to 2.

       Connect it to your "Nod" box as below (outputs with inputs):

Test   |roboN| nods two times and talk.

       Itâ€™s not bad but we also want NAO to start waving after he has finished nodding
       and talking. This is quite simple: a **Wait For Signals** box should be used.

4.     Add a **Flow Control** > **Wait For Signals** box.

       Connect the **onStopped** output of **Say** box to its **Signal 1** input
       and the **onStopped** output of **For** to its **Signal 2** input.

       The **Wait For Signals** box stimulates its output once the two inputs are
       stimulated.

5.     Add a **Motions** > **Animations** > **Hello** box.

          :width: 505 px
          :height: 406 px

Test   |roboN| starts waving after he has finished nodding and talking!

6.     As a final exercise, you could create a single box that perform all these
       actions.

       :ref:`choregraphe-howto-convert-boxes-to-one-box`.
