This tutorial will show you how to create a movement using the **Animation mode**.

*Create the following behavior*: starting from the **Init** pose of the pose library,
animate your robot in order to put it in the position of the famous sculpture called **The thinker** by Rodin.

Start **Animation Mode** and store the first position:

=====  ======================================================================================
Step       Action
=====  ======================================================================================
1.      Make sure you are connected to a real robot.

2.      Awake your robot by clicking the |wakeup-button| **Wake Up** button. If the button is
        disabled, it means that your robot is already awake.

3.      Your robot should now be in the **StandInit** posture. If it isn't, you can
        do it by using the **Pose library**.

        Your robot in the **Init** pose should look like that:

        .. image:: /medias/desktop/choregraphe/animation_mode_mov1.png
            :width: 200 px
            :height: 389 px

4.      Create a new **Timeline box**.

5.      Double click the box in order to display the **Timeline**.

6.      Click the |animation-mode-green| **Animation mode** button.

        The button turns red: |animation-mode-red|, meaning the **Animation Mode** is on.

7.      *Store the first position:*

        Tap the head tactile sensors with your hand.
=====  ======================================================================================

To define the second position, we will decompose the movement:

=====  ======================================================================================
Step       Action
=====  ======================================================================================
1.      Hold your robot by the waist/torso to prevent it to fall down.

2.      Push the two foot bumpers to set off the **Stiffness** of the legs.

3.      Lower the torso in order to flex legs, your robot should look like that:

        .. image:: /medias/desktop/choregraphe/animation_mode_mov2.png
            :width: 200 px
            :height: 323 px

4.      Move the right foot forward and turn it a little on the right like in the following
        picture:

        .. image:: /medias/desktop/choregraphe/animation_mode_mov3.png
            :width: 200 px
            :height: 319 px

5.      Push the two foot bumpers in order to set on the **Stiffness** of the legs.

6.      *Store the second position:*

        Tap the head tactile sensors with your hand.
=====  ======================================================================================

The next part of the movement will involve the arms and the head of the robot.

=====  ======================================================================================
Step       Action
=====  ======================================================================================
1.      Touch the middle head tactile sensor in order to set off the **Stiffness** 
        of the head.

2.      Lower the head until it is no longer possible.

3.      Touch the middle head tactile sensor in order to set on the **Stiffness**
        of the head.

4.      Tilt the torso forward.

5.      Raise the right hand to the head.

6.      Make sure the position is stable.

7.      If it is, store the position.

        If not, tilt the torso backward until the position remains stable and
        store the position.

        Your robot should look like that:

        .. image:: /medias/desktop/choregraphe/animation_mode_mov4.png
            :width: 200 px
            :height: 273 px

8.      Click the |animation-mode-red| **Animation mode** button again to stop it, or
        touch all the **Head tactile sensors**.

        The button turns green: |animation-mode-green|.
=====  ======================================================================================

Creating a movement from scratch
--------------------------------

In **Choregraphe**, it is very easy to create simple movements in no time.

=====  =================================================================================    =====================================================================
Step       Action                                                                           Further help
=====  =================================================================================    =====================================================================
1.      Drag and drop the **Template** > **Animation** box onto the
        :ref:`chore_flow_diagram_panel`.

2.      Double-click the box to enter it.

        An empty :ref:`Timeline<choregraphe-reference-box-timeline>` is displayed.

3.      Set the robot in a starting position.                                               To quickly set the robot in a position, you can click on a predefined
                                                                                            position in :ref:`chore_pose_library_panel`.

4.      Right-click on the :ref:`Frame <choregraphe-reference-box-frame>` 5 of the          Having a keyframe at index 1 is not advised: it would mean that the
        the :ref:`Motion layer <choregraphe-reference-box-motion-layer>`.                   robot, from an unknown position when entering the box, should go to
                                                                                            this position in no time and the keyframe would probably be ignored.

5.      Click on one of the robot limbs to display the
        :ref:`choregraphe-detailed-interface-motion-widget`.

        .. note::

           Whenever there is a current frame cursor (the blue line) on the
           Timeline, the motion editing is on.

6.      In the :ref:`choregraphe-detailed-interface-motion-widget`,
        you can add some joint values of the selected limb
        in the current keyframe, moving a limb will automatically add the joint
        value to the selected keyframe.

Creating a movement with a real NAO robot to define the joints values
---------------------------------------------------------------------

|no-virtual| *Cannot be tested on a simulated robot*.

------------------------

.. warning::

    The **Stiffness** of Head motors have to be set off.

This tutorial explains how to use a real robot to create a movement.

We will see how to define joints values by moving the real robot.

Saving the head joints values using the **Robot view**
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When you change the real NAO position, you can see that the virtual 3D NAO changes position too. Try to raise NAO's arm for example.

.. image:: /medias/dev/tutos/choregraphe/chore_position_reflected.jpg

Wouldn't it be nice to use this feature to create position keyframes on a motion Timeline?

Now, letâ€™s say we want NAO to move its head up in the first keyframe and to keep its arms down:

#. Click on the first keyframe

#. Click on the head of the virtual 3D NAO to open the :ref:`choregraphe-detailed-interface-motion-widget`.

#. Move the real NAO robot head to the position you want.

#. Click on the two record buttons of the :ref:`choregraphe-detailed-interface-motion-widget`
   as in the following picture:

   .. image:: /medias/dev/tutos/choregraphe/chore_clicking_record.png

   The head joints values have been saved in the first keyframe.

Saving the arm joints values using the "Store joints in keyframe" options
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

#. Move the real NAO robot arms to put them down.

#. Click on **Stiffen chain on/off** in the :ref:`choregraphe-detailed-interface-motion-widget`.

   The robot doesn't move.

#. Right-click on the first keyframe and select the **Store joints in keyframe** option.

   .. note::

      This feature allows you to save the joints values of NAO: the joints of the whole body, the head, the arms or the legs.

#. As we want to save the joints values of the arms, click on **Arms**.

   .. image:: /medias/dev/tutos/choregraphe/chore_store_joints.png

   The joints values of the arms have been saved in the first keyframe.

Raising the arms in a second keyframe
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

#. Left click the motion Timeline to change the current edition frame (the blue line).

   A second keyframe is displayed on the motion Timeline.

#. Move the real NAO robot arms to the position you want.

#. Click on **Stiffen chain on/off** in the :ref:`choregraphe-detailed-interface-motion-widget`.

   The robot doesn't move.

#. Right click on the second keyframe and select **Store joints in keyframe > Arms**.

   The joints values of the arms have been saved in the second keyframe.

Thanks to the **Store joints in keyframe** option, we were able to save the values of 8 joints (4 joints per arm) in a keyframe in only a single click.

.. note::

   When you right-click on a keyframe, the **Remove joints from keyframe** option allows you to easily remove the joints values that have been saved in a keyframe.
   You can choose to remove the joints values of the whole body, or only the values of the head, arms, legs or forearms.
