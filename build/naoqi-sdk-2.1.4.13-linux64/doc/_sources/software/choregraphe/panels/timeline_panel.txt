.. _choregraphe-reference-box-timeline:

What is a Timeline
-------------------

A **Timeline** enables you to easily synchronize boxes with movements, movements with each other
and/or :ref:`Boxes <choregraphe-reference-box>` with each other.

A **Timeline** is constituted by:

* a :ref:`choregraphe-reference-box-motion-layer` which contains movements.
* Optionally one or several :ref:`Behavior layers <choregraphe-reference-box-behavior-layer>`
  which contain **Flow diagrams** NAO will execute in addition to its movements.

Timeline execution
+++++++++++++++++++

The whole **Timeline** is based on a time ruler.
The time is represented on the **Timeline** by numbered :ref:`Frames <choregraphe-reference-box-frame>`.
Each **Frame** corresponds to a position of the robot and/or :ref:`Flow diagrams <choregraphe-reference-box-flow-diagram>` to execute.

When a **Timeline** is started, the :ref:`choregraphe-reference-box-timeline-time-cursor`
is placed on the :ref:`Start frame <choregraphe-reference-box-frame-start>`.
Then it is regularly incremented to the next Frame, until it gets to the
:ref:`End frame <choregraphe-reference-box-frame-end>`.

The speed to move from a **Frame** to another is defined by the **Frame rate** of the Timeline.
For further details, see :ref:`timeline-properties`.

.. note::

    The automatic process regularly moving the
    :ref:`choregraphe-reference-box-timeline-time-cursor` to the next
    Frame can be affected (stopped, restarted, moved to another Frame) by the
    :ref:`sub-boxes <choregraphe-reference-box-parent>` and the :ref:`script of
    the box <choregraphe-reference-box-script>`.
    For example, the **Goto And Stop** boxes move the cursor to a specific frame
    and pause the cursor so that it will not move to the next frame.

=====  =======================================================  ===================================================================

.. _choregraphe-reference-box-frame:

Frames
++++++++

| The **Frame** is the unit of a :ref:`Timeline <choregraphe-reference-box-timeline>`.
| Each Frame has a **number of frame** which corresponds to its position in the Timeline.
|

When the :ref:`choregraphe-reference-box-timeline-time-cursor` gets to a Frame, simultaneously:

* the joint values stored to this Frame are applied to the robot.
* the :ref:`Flow diagram <choregraphe-reference-box-flow-diagram>` of each
  :ref:`Behavior keyframe <choregraphe-reference-box-behavior-keyframe>` placed on
  this Frame are :ref:`loaded <choregraphe-reference-loading-unloading>` (if they have not been loaded yet).


.. _choregraphe-reference-box-frame-start:

Start frame
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **Start frame** is a specific :ref:`choregraphe-reference-box-frame`.

When the Timeline is started, the :ref:`choregraphe-reference-box-timeline-time-cursor`
is directly placed at this Frame.

Any Frame which is before the **Start frame** will not be reached.

If you force the :ref:`choregraphe-reference-box-timeline-time-cursor` to move
on one of those Frames (with a **Goto And Play** box for example),
this will have the same result as going to the :ref:`choregraphe-reference-box-frame-end`.


.. _choregraphe-reference-box-frame-end:

End frame
^^^^^^^^^^

The **End frame** is a specific :ref:`choregraphe-reference-box-frame`.

As soon as the :ref:`choregraphe-reference-box-timeline-time-cursor` gets to this Frame:

#. The :ref:`choregraphe-reference-box-timeline-time-cursor` is paused.
   So it stops being incremented.
#. If there is any **onStopped** :ref:`output <choregraphe-reference-box-output>`:

   * The Timeline is :ref:`unloaded <choregraphe-reference-loading-unloading>`.
   * The first **onStopped** :ref:`output <choregraphe-reference-box-output>` of the box is stimulated.

.. warning:

   If there is no **onStopped** output, the Timeline will not be
   :ref:`unloaded <choregraphe-reference-loading-unloading>`, so the
   :ref:`Behavior layers <choregraphe-reference-box-behavior-layer>`
   present at this Frame can still be running.

Any Frame which is after the **End frame** will not be reached.

If you force the :ref:`choregraphe-reference-box-timeline-time-cursor`
to move on one of those Frames (with a **Goto And Play** box for example),
this will have the same result as going to the **End frame**.


How to set Start and End frames
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, **Start frame** is set to the Frame **0** and **End frame** is set just
before the last **Motion frame** defined.

To move **Start frame** or **End frame**:

* Drag them on the ruler or
* Right-click on a Frame number and choose **Set start frame here** or **Set end frame here**.

To reset them to the default value:

* Right-click on a Frame number and choose **Reset start here** or **Reset end here**.


.. _choregraphe-reference-box-timeline-time-cursor:

Time cursor
+++++++++++

The **Time cursor** represents the currently executed Frame in the Timeline.

Value of the Time cursor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For a :ref:`choregraphe-reference-box-type-timeline`, the value of the **Time cursor**:

* is the number of the executed Frame, or
* is equal to -1 when its :ref:`Timeline <choregraphe-reference-box-timeline>` has not been started or has been stopped.

For a :ref:`choregraphe-reference-box-type-flow-diagram`, its value is systematically equal to -1.

A :ref:`choregraphe-reference-box-type-script` has no **Time cursor**.

.. _choregraphe-howto-value-time-cursor:

How to get the value of the Time cursor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can access to the value of the :ref:`choregraphe-reference-box-timeline-time-cursor`
of a Timeline box from its :ref:`Script <choregraphe-reference-box-script>` with the following command:

.. code-block:: python

   timeCursor = ALMemory.getData( self.id )

You can also access to it from the script of a :ref:`child box <choregraphe-reference-box-parent>` with the following command:

.. code-block:: python

   timeCursor = ALMemory.getData( self.parentId )

.. warning::
   A :ref:`choregraphe-reference-box-type-script` has no **Time cursor**.
   So if you try to call the first command above in a script box, it will return an error.



.. _choregraphe-reference-box-motion-layer:

Motion layer
-------------

The **Motion layer** is where NAO's movements are stored in the :ref:`Timeline <choregraphe-reference-box-timeline>`.

Each :ref:`choregraphe-reference-box-motion-keyframe` on the **Motion layer**
corresponds to a position of the robot or a part of its body.

.. image:: /medias/desktop/choregraphe/chore_ref_motion_layer.png
   :width: 493 px
   :height: 213 px

.. note::

   As there are several joints stored in this **Motion layer**, we can say it is
   made with several sub-motion layers, each of them corresponding to a joint.
   They are the sub-layers you can see when opening the :ref:`choregraphe-detailed-interface-timeline-editor`.

.. _choregraphe-reference-box-motion-keyframe:

Motion keyframe
++++++++++++++++

A **Motion keyframe** represents a position of the robot or a part of its body.

It contains the angle values of the stored joints.

When the :ref:`choregraphe-reference-box-timeline-time-cursor` gets to a **Motion keyframe**,
the joint values stored to this frame are applied to the robot.


Interpolation
++++++++++++++

The **Motion layer** contains :ref:`choregraphe-reference-box-motion-keyframe`
representing specific positions set by the person who made the movement.

Then an interpolation of joint values is automatically made in order to obtain
intermediate positions between two :ref:`Motion keyframes <choregraphe-reference-box-motion-keyframe>`.

.. note::

   You can choose the type of interpolation between the :ref:`choregraphe-reference-box-motion-keyframe`
   in the :ref:`choregraphe-detailed-interface-timeline-editor`.



Editing Motion keyframes
--------------------------

**Motion keyframes** can be created and modified directly on the :ref:`motion-ruler` or
using the :ref:`choregraphe-detailed-interface-timeline-editor`.


.. _motion-ruler:

Motion ruler
+++++++++++++

| The Motion ruler gives a summarized view of the **Motion** layer, allowing you to create and edit animations.

=====  =====================================  ===============================================================================



Creating
++++++++++

To insert a new **Motion keyframe** with the robot's current position:

1. Right-click a frame in the grey Timeline and choose **Store joints in keyframe**.
2. Choose the joints you want to store the value of (**Whole body**, **Head**, **Arms** or **Legs**).

   A dark grey rectangle appears, containing all the joint values of the selected part of the robot.

| You can also create a **Motion keyframe** containing only the joint values you select one by one.
| For further details, see: :ref:`store-joints`.
|

To create several **Motion keyframes**, using the real robot like a puppet,
see: :ref:`choregraphe-howto-use-animation-mode`.

Selecting
++++++++++

To select:

* a **Motion keyframe**, simply click on it.

  The robot will automatically take the **position** corresponding to this **Motion keyframe**.

* several **Motion keyframes**, drag and drop in the grey Timeline.

* all **Motion keyframes**, right-click the grey Timeline and choose **Selection** > **Select all**.

.. note::
   The option **Select from layer** is only useful in the :ref:`choregraphe-detailed-interface-timeline-editor`.

Removing
+++++++++

To remove the values of some joints from any **Motion keyframe**:

1. Select one or several **Motion keyframe**.

2. Right-click it and choose **Remove joints from keyframe**.

3. Choose the joints you want to remove (**Whole body**, **Head**, **Arms** or **Legs**).

| You can also edit a **Motion keyframe** and remove a value using the :ref:`choregraphe-detailed-interface-motion-widget`.
| For further details, see: :ref:`delete-joints-values`.
|

Moving
++++++++

To move **Motion keyframes** within the Timeline:

1. Select one or several **Motion keyframe**.

2. Drag them.

or

1. Select one or several **Motion keyframe**.

2. Right-click it and choose **Copy** or **Cut**.

3. Click on the Timeline in order to place the **insertion point** (see :ref:`motion-ruler`).

4. Right-click it and choose **Paste**.

.. note::

   If the **Keyframe** you have pasted is **empty**, this could mean that there
   is a conflict with contradictory values for the same joint at this frame.

.. _chore_flip:

Flipping
++++++++

The values of left and right joints can be **swapped** using the **Flip** option in the contextual menu.
Then you can select where to apply the swap (**Whole timeline**, **Selected frames**, **Selected keys**).

For example if the robot moves his right arm during the whole Timeline and you flip it,
then it will move his left arm from now on instead.

.. _chore_mirroring:

Mirroring
+++++++++

The values of left can be copied to the right and vice-versa using the
**Mirror** option in the contextual menu. Then you can select where to apply
the mirroring (**Whole timeline**, **Selected frames**, **Selected keys**).

For example if the robot waves with his right arm during the whole Timeline
and you mirror it, then it will wave with both arms.

Spreading / tightening
+++++++++++++++++++++++

to change the gap between **Motion keyframes**:

1. Select a **range of frames** by dragging the **Frame numbers**.

   The selected **range of frames** is represented by a blue square surrounded by purple triangles.

2. Drag the right purple triangle to resize the selected chunk of motion layer.

   Note that the left purple triangle allows you to move the selected chunk of motion layer.


.. note::
   Since a chunk of motion layer may contain **Motion keyframes**, they are moved as the selection is moved.
   They also adapt themselves to the new size of the selection.
   As the size of the selection grows, the duration between **Motion keyframes** grows too.

Exporting C++ / Python
+++++++++++++++++++++++

To export an animation to C++ or Python code:

1. Select one or several **Motion keyframes**.
2. Right-click them and select **Export motion to clipboard**.
3. Select a language (**C++** or **Python**) and a mode (**Bezier** or **simplified**).
4. Paste it in your code.

   The robot will make the same movements when this code is executed.

                                  each box and some more settings.

                                  We recommend you to update your older behaviors and set the
                                  :ref:`resources <choregraphe-reference-box-resource>` of the boxes
                                  of your behaviors. To do so, see the section
                                  :ref:`choregraphe-howto-set-resources-for-box`.

                              Allows you to manage conflicts between commands sent to the same joint.

                              You can choose several modes:

                              * **Passive**: The motion will be done if it can be done. If it cannot,
                                then it will not.
                              * **Waiting**: The motion will be done as soon as the joints will be
                                available i.e. not being doing another motion.
                              * **Aggressive Mode (unsafe)**: The motion will be done anyway, even if
                                another command has been asked on the same joint.
