QiChat script
==============

QiChat
------

**qiChat** is the language used to write **Dialog Topic** boxes.

For further details see: :ref:`QiChat<dialog_toc>`.

Default script
---------------

By default, when you create a box its script looks as follows:

   :width: 335 px
   :height: 389 px

The topic name is created using the name you gave to the box, and the language
is the one you have selected during box creation.

Adding rules
------------

To add rules, see the syntax here: :ref:`dialog_rules`.

You can also pick chunk of code using the auto-completion tool:
use **Ctrl-Space** to display it.

Note that when a long name is splitted by slashes **/**
(like ``$Device/SubDeviceList/Battery/Current/Sensor/Value``),
the auto-completion tool allows you select it chunk by chunk.
