.. _choregraphe-reference-box-parameter:

Parameter of a box
------------------

What is a parameter
+++++++++++++++++++

A parameter of a box is a value which enables you to slightly change the actions made by your box.

.. note::
   You can know if a box has parameters if it has a |parameter-button| button displayed at the bottom-left corner of the box.

The value of the parameters can be set using the :ref:`choregraphe-detailed-interface-setting-box-parameter` or by connecting an :abbr:`I/O (input/output)` on it.

A parameter has:

* a **Name** which has to be unique for each box, as you access the parameter value from its name in the :ref:`python_script`.
* a **Tooltip** which is very important.

  Indeed, you only see the parameter name when you edit its value.
  So it can be useful to have this little tooltip to describe the purpose of the parameter.
* an option named **Inherits from parent**.

  When this option is enabled, if there is :ref:`a parent box <choregraphe-reference-box-parent>` of this box which has a parameter with the **same name** as this parameter, then the **value of this parameter** will be the **value of the parameter of this parent box**.
  Then setting the value of this parameter is useless.

  .. note::
     Even if the parent box parameter has not the same type, it is its value that is taken into account.

     Also, if there is no parent box with a parameter with the same name, the value of the parameter is directly taken in to account.
* a **Type**:

* a **Default value** which is the original value of the parameter if you do not change it.


.. _choregraphe-detailed-interface-setting-box-parameter:

Widget to set the value of box parameters
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When you click on the **parameter button** |parameter-button| of a box in the flow diagram, or when you right-click on a box and select **Set Parameters**, the following widget is displayed:

.. image:: /medias/desktop/choregraphe/chore_set_parameter_value.png

.. note::
   If there is no **parameter button** on the box, it means that the box has **no parameter**.
   So you need either to add some (right-click on the box, **Edit box**) or choose an other box which has parameters.

The **name** of the parameters are on the left and their **value** you can set are on the right.

You can notice in the example above that you can have several types of parameters.
If you want more information about these types, see the section: :ref:`Parameter of a box <choregraphe-reference-box-parameter>`.

There is an option **Auto-update parameters on robot** at the bottom of the widget.
If this option is enabled, then the value of the parameters are updated during the execution of the behavior.

For example, let's play a long song with the ``Play Sound`` box.
To know how to do this, see the tutorial: :ref:`Playing music <playing-music-tuto>`.
If you set the value of the ``Volume (%)`` parameter while it is playing, then it will be updated.
It would not be the case if the option **Auto-update parameters on robot** was disabled.

You can also reset the value of all parameters to their **default value** by clicking on the button **Reset to default**.


Parameter edition widgets
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When you **create** or **edit** a :ref:`box parameter <choregraphe-reference-box-parameter>`, the following widget is displayed:

.. image:: /medias/desktop/choregraphe/chore_edit_parameter.png

You can here set:

* the **name** of the parameter.
* the brief **description** of what effect has this parameter on the box in the field **Tooltip**.

  .. note::
     This description will appear in a tooltip displayed by **passing above the parameter value** in the :ref:`widget to set the value of box parameters <choregraphe-detailed-interface-setting-box-parameter>`.

* the **Inherits from parent** option which says if the parameter value is overwritten by the parent parameter value.

You can also choose the **type** of the parameter and its **content** depending on its type:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 5 100
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Type
     - Content
   * - Boolean
     - You can set the **default value** of the parameter (True or False).
       It is the original value of the parameter if you do not change it.
   * - Integer
     - You can set:

       * the **default value** of the parameter (value between **Min value** and **Max value**).
       * the **minimum value** of the parameter.
       * the **maximum value** of the parameter.
   * - Float
     - You can set:

       * the **default value** of the parameter (value between **Min value** and **Max value**).
       * the **minimum value** of the parameter.
       * the **maximum value** of the parameter.
   * - String
     - You can set the **default value** of the parameter.

       You can add, edit and remove **possible values** of the parameter in the field **Multiple Choices**.

       Then you can set the list of possible values exclusive or not with the option **Custom string possible**.
       If this option is disabled, it is exclusive.
       The **default value** of the parameter is then the value currently displayed in the field **Multiple Choices**.

       If you did not have defined any choice in the field **Multiple Choices**, you can set the option **Password**.
       When this option is enabled, the value of the parameter is displayed as a password in the :ref:`widget to set the value of box parameters <choregraphe-detailed-interface-setting-box-parameter>` so that each character is hidden.
   * - Attached file
     - You can set the **default value** of the parameter (for example ``/sounds/play.wav``).

For further details about these types of parameters, see the section: :ref:`choregraphe-reference-box-parameter`.



.. _ choregraphe-howto-set-value-box-parameter

How to set the value of a box parameter
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In Choregraphe some boxes such as the **Motion > Walk To** box have parameters,
those parameters are useful for the execution of the box and need to be set.

Parameters are accessible by the two following ways:

* Click the adjustable wrench on the bottom left corner of the box or
* Right click the box and choose **Set parameters** in the contextual menu.

Set the parameters and click **ok**.

        will help you to set the properties of the input/output/parameter you
        are editing.
=====  ============================================================================



.. _choregraphe-reference-attached-files:

Attached files of a behavior or a box
---------------------------------------

The attached files of a :ref:`behavior <choregraphe-reference-behavior>` (or a :ref:`box <choregraphe-reference-box>`) are the **additional files** which are needed for the **execution** of the behavior (or the box).
For example, to execute the Tai Chi Chuan dance, you need the music that goes with it.

So in order to **package** the behavior (or the box) with its needed files, they can be attached to the behavior (or the box) so that they automatically come with it.
To see a practical example of how to attach a file to a behavior and a box, see the tutorial: :ref:`choregraphe-tuto-attach-file-to-box`.

.. warning::
   If you want to share a behavior which uses a specific **image recognition database**, you may wish to attach the database to the behavior so that NAO uses it during the execution of the behavior.
   But it is not possible for the time being as there is no available API to send a such database to the robot.
   The feature is coming soon but unfortunately for now you will have to:

   * **export** the database using the :ref:`video-monitor-panel`.
   * share it next to the behavior.
   * precise that, before executing the behavior, the image recognition database needs to be **sent** to the robot using the :ref:`video-monitor-panel`.

When you drag and drop a box which has **attached files** from the :ref:`chore_box_libary_panel` to the :ref:`chore_flow_diagram_panel`,
the files attached to this box are **added** to the files attached to the current behavior.

.. warning::
   If a file **already exists** in the list of files attached to the current behavior, then the old file will be **replaced** by the new file.



.. _choregraphe-reference-box-resource:

Resource of a box
---------------------

A resource is an element needed for executing a task (a :ref:`box <choregraphe-reference-box>`
or a :ref:`behavior <choregraphe-reference-behavior>`).

For example, to walk, the robot uses the resource of the legs.
To dance, the robot uses the resources of the audio player, the arms and the legs.

Many resources can only be used once at a time (the legs for example).
Thus you need to manage conflicts between tasks which use the same resources.

The :ref:`choregraphe-detailed-interface-box-edition-resources` allows you to set,
for each box, the resources that are used, and how to manage the resources between boxes.

Managing the resources is important when exchanging behaviors for two reasons:

**For resolving conflicts**

Let's say we have two behaviors:

* One makes the robot dance on a music (``Tai Chi Chuan`` box for example).
* The second makes the robot walk when the left bumper is pressed.

If they both are running at the same time, the two behaviors may send contradictory
commands to the legs.

**For synchronizing resources**

If your behavior makes the robot greet with the left hand and say Hello,
both resources need to be available at the same time for the behavior to start.

.. _choregraphe-detailed-interface-box-edition-resources:

Box resource selector
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To display the **Box resource selector**, right click the box and choose
**Edit resources**.

.. image:: /medias/desktop/choregraphe/box_resource_selector_letters.png
    :width: 341 px
    :height: 448 px

=====  ======================== ==============================================================================================================
Part    Name                     Allows you to ...
=====  ======================== ==============================================================================================================
**A**   **Resource list**        Tick the resources that are used by your box.

                                 While they are used by your box, they will be only by your box.

**B**  **At box startup**        Choose what happens at the startup of the box.

                                 Indeed if one of the resources you ticked has already been taken by another
                                 box, then it is **unavailable** for your box.
                                 Then your box is started, it can react in different ways:

                                 * **Cancel immediately**: The box is not started.

                                 * **Wait** some time: The box waits a certain amount of time for the availability of the resources.
                                   As soon as the resources are available, the box does not wait anymore and is immediately started.
                                   If resources are still not available once time is elapsed, then the box is not started.

                                   You can set the time to wait with the spin box which is displayed when you select the option **Wait**.

                                 * **Wait infinitely**: The box waits forever for the resource availability before it can be started.
                                   As soon as the resources are available, the box does not wait anymore and is immediately started.

**C**   **During box exection**  Choose what happens during the **execution** of your box.

                                 Indeed you need to choose how your box will react if one of the resources it uses is **demanded**
                                 by another box:

                                 * **Lock**: Your box ignores the demand of the other box and keeps running.
                                   Then it does not release the resources and the other box cannot be started.

                                 * **Stop the box**: Your box is :ref:`stopped <choregraphe-reference-loading-unloading>` and then releases
                                   the resources for the other box.

                                   Note that the box may take some time to stop and to release the resources.
                                   So if the other box resources are set to **Cancel immediately**, it may not be started because
                                   the resources were not immediately available.

                                 * **Trigger box callback**: The ``onResource(resourceName)`` function, (if any) in the
                                   :ref:`python_script` of your box, is called.
                                   The parameter of this function is the name of the demanded resource.

                                 .. note::

                                     This is an option for advanced users only.
                                     For more information about this kind of built-in functions, see the section:
                                     :ref:`Built-in functions in the script of a box <choregraphe-reference-box-script-built-in-functions>`.

                                 * **Pause box timeline (deprecated)**: The **Timeline** (if any) of your box is **paused** at the current
                                   frame. The Timeline is then **played again** as soon as the resources are available again.

                                 .. warning::
                                     This option is **deprecated** since 1.14 and will be removed in later version.

**D**   **Detect** button        Make Choregraphe try to automatically detect the resources used by your box.

                                 .. warning::
                                    This function may miss some resource you use in your box.
                                    So we advise that, after clicking on this button, you make sure yourself that every resource your box uses
                                    is ticked.

.. _choregraphe-reference-box-plugin:

Plugin of a box
----------------

A box plugin adds a **user interface** directly on the **frontage** of the box.
For example, if you choose the ``numberedit`` plugin then you will be able to choose a number directly from the box frontage instead of in parameters.

It automatically generates a :ref:`python_script` for the box which then will not be editable.

It can also be useful if you want to make specific commands during the edition of your :ref:`behavior <choregraphe-reference-behavior>`.
For example, if you choose the ``ui_choice`` plugin then in advanced options (the + button) you will have a button to calculate the approximative recognition confidence of each word.

.. note::
   We strongly advise you to use :ref:`parameters <choregraphe-reference-box-parameter>` instead of plugin as it is a very advanced feature to use.
