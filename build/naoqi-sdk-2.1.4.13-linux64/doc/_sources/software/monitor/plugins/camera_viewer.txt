**A**   **Viewer** settings        The following settings have an impact limited to the display on **Camera viewer**,
                                   and has no impact on video recording:
                                   **whatever the settings, videos are recorded in QVGA (320*240)
                                   at 15 fps, with MJPG compression.**

                                   * **Framerate:** set the maximum framerate you want to display. The lower the
                                       lighter will be the charge for both your robot's CPU and your LAN.

                                       .. warning::
                                           High rates of high resolution frames sometimes cannot be reached.
                                           You can ensure better conditions by stopping all consuming programs and
                                           by setting a wired connection with your robot.

                                   * **Resolution**

                                   * **Black and white**

                                   * **Mark detection:** detect NAOmarks and locate them on the image.

                                   * **Vision recognition:** detect learnt objects and locate them on the image.

**B**   **Camera** settings        The following settings impact video recording and all the modules which use the
                                   cameras.

                                   * **Exposure:** check **Auto exposition** to automatically set the exposition
                                     time. When unchecked, **Exposure** slider is enabled to let you set the
                                     parameter manually. A long exposition time may slow the framerate, but gets
                                     a brighter image with less noise.

                                   * **Gain:** check **Auto gain** to automatically set the gain. When unchecked,
                                     **Gain** slider is enabled to let you set the parameter manually. A great
                                     gain will make a brighter image, but may amplify noise.

                                   * **Exposure correction:** additional exposure correction taking place after
                                     exposure and gain operation.

                                   * **White balance:** check **Auto white balance** to automatically set the
                                     white balance. When unchecked, **Blue / Red chroma:** sliders are enabled
                                     to let you set color proportions in the image manually.

                                   * **Brightness / Contrast / Hue**

                                   * **Vertical / Horizontal flip**

**C**   Action Buttons             **Play** |monitor-camera-play| starts retrieving and displaying images from your
                                   robot in the video widget.

                                   **Pause** |monitor-camera-pause| pauses video display and stops requesting images.

                                   **Record** |monitor-camera-record| starts recording a video.
                                   |monitor-camera-stop| stop recording the video and prompts for a
                                   destination file.

                                   **Snapshot** |monitor-camera-snapshot| takes three pictures (a,b,c) of what the robot
                                   sees. The files will be saved to:
                                   /home/nao/.local/share/naoqi/vision/{timestamp}{a,b,c}.jpg

                                   **Switch camera:** switches between head's front and bottom cameras.


**D**   **Video Recorder** tab     This panel allows you to define the file name used to store the video on the robot.

                                   It also displays information about the last recorded video file.
