Best practices
================

Charging |roboN|
----------------

Plug the adaptor into |roboN|'s back while he's in a stable position and leave him
to charge for at least 2 hours. He should not walk or lie down while charging.

Ethernet cable
-----------------

When plugged into Ethernet, |roboN| should not walk, lie down or perform behaviors
which could move his head too far (particularly tilting his head back), as the
plug could damage his head. The WiFi connection is the recommended connection.


Hands
------

Avoid playing with |roboN|'s fingers and rotating his hands when turned off.

Safe Poses
-----------

|roboN| needs to be in a stable position when he's not in use or while charging,
like in this picture.

Fix |roboN|'s base onto a horizontal surface with 4 screws.

Safe Area
----------

You should prevent |roboN| from falling. Yet if he falls, he should not hurt any
object or fall from a high surface, such as a table. A safe working area is
shown in the figures opposite.

The way you position |roboN| is also important to prevent |roboN| from falling
or hurting himself. Place him in a stable position when pressing his chest button,
or when plugging a cable. before starting a move, make sure he can perform it
from his current position.

When turned off, the best position is to have |roboN| lying down on his back,
with no cable plugged.


Recommendations
-----------------

- Precautions: take all necessary precautions to ensure that |roboN| will not be
  directly or indirectly damaged by its surroundings. Do not exert strong forces
  on |roboN| and protect it from falls. Do not make |roboN| walk on thick carpets
  or rugs, mattresses, clothes. |roboN| will move about properly if the floor is
  flat, hard and smooth. Do not block its sensors or introduce foreign objects
  into its body. Do not use |roboN| outdoors.

- Handling: if you need to handle or move |roboN|, it is best to hold it with
  both hands by the waist/torso. Do not pull it by the arms, legs or head.

- Water: do not expose |roboN| to any form of water as permanent damage may occur.
  In particular, if |roboN| switches from a cold environment to a warm one,
  condensation may occur on its surface or inside. In that case, let |roboN|
  dry before turning it on.

- Temperature: |roboN| is designed to function between 10 and 35 °C ( 50-95 F).

- Humidity: |roboN| is designed to function within 10% to 90% relative humidity.

- Electrical shock: do not attempt to disassemble or modify |roboN|, as this can
  cause malfunction/damage or result in electrical shock.

- Children and pets: do not let children or pets interact with |roboN|.

- Storage: when not intending to use |roboN| for a long time, remove the battery
  and store it in a dry location, at temperatures between 0 and 45 °C (32- 113 F).
  Be aware that during storage, the battery will be subject to discharge. Also
  bear in mind that the charge capacity of the battery will decrease in time.

- Transport: the robot must always be transported in its original packing or in
  a specific suitcase sold by Aldebaran Robotics. Any other packing may damage
  the robot and void the warranty.


- Battery handling: do not expose the battery to temperatures above 45 °C (113°F).
  Protect the battery terminals from dust or foreign objects.

- Cleaning: clean |roboN| and charger with a soft, dry cloth only. Do not use
  solvents.

- Do not oil |roboN|'s joints or other movable parts.

- Lithium-ion rechargeable batteries are recyclable. You can help preserve our
  environment by returning your used rechargeable battery to the collection and
  recycling location nearest you.

- For information regarding the AC adapter, please refer to the manual provided
  separately.

Safety
-------

- Periodically examine the AC adapter for conditions that may result in the risk
  of fire, electric shock, or injury to persons (such as damage to the cords,
  blades, housing). In the event of such conditions, the AC adapter should not
  be used until properly replaced.

- The robot must be used only with the recommended AC adapter and battery. Use
  of another type of adapter and/or battery may result in malfunction and voids
  the warranty.

- If the external flexible cable or cord is damaged, it must be replaced or
  repaired only by the manufacturer, an authorized service agent or a similar
  qualified person in order to avoid a hazard.

- All material for fastening or packing purposes are not part of the robot and
  should be disregarded for children's safety.

- Do not handle damaged or leaking lithium ion batteries.

- There is a risk of explosion if the battery is incorrectly replaced. Replace
  only with an Aldebaran battery. Discard used batteries according to the
  manufacturer's instructions.

- The battery pack used in this device may present a fire or chemical burn hazard
  if mistreated. Do not disassemble, heat above 60 °C (140 °F ) or incinerate.
  Dispose of used battery promptly. Keep away from children. Do not disassemble
  and do not dispose of in fire.

- Do not drop the battery pack or place heavy object on it. Do not apply strong
  pressure or physical shock to the battery pack.

- In case of troubles with your electrical power circuit, immediately unplug
  |roboN|'s charger.
