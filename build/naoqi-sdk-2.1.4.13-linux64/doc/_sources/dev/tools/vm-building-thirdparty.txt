.. _vm-usage:

Using the NAOqi OS in a virtual machine
========================================

This section gives some hints about how to build third-party software for NAO.

Before starting, make sure the **NAOqi OS** virtual machine already setup and
running. If it is not the case:

* refer to :ref:`vm-setup` to setup the **NAOqi OS** virtual machine;

* refer to :ref:`vm-using` to start the **NAOqi OS** virtual machine;

* refer to :ref:`vm-accessing` to login on the **NAOqi OS** virtual machine.

Tweaking the NAOqi OS virtual machine
--------------------------------------

.. _vm-optimize-builds:

Optimizing builds for Atom targets
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

As root, make the ``/etc/portage`` symlink point to:

* ``/etc/portage.generic`` to build x86-generic binary.
  targets;

* ``/etc/portage.atom`` to build optimized binaries for Atom targets;

To change, just run the following commands:

.. code-block:: console

    # Here, set optimizations for Atom (a.k.a. NAO V4):
    su
    rm -fi /etc/portage
    ln -sfv /etc/portage.atom /etc/portage
    exit

    # do some developments...

    # Then you can switch back to the generic settings:
    su
    rm -fi /etc/portage
    ln -sfv /etc/portage.generic /etc/portage
    exit

Building the third-party software
---------------------------------

.. _vm-usage-emerge:

emerge usage
++++++++++++

``emerge`` is the package manager used by Gentoo, **NAOqi OS**.

As usual, do not hesitate to checkout the ``emerge`` documentation
http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?part=2&chap=1#doc_chap3
or the its man page:

.. code-block:: console

    man emerge

This section gives the most often used ``emerge`` commands.

.. warning::

    Never run:

    .. code-block:: console

        emerge --sync

    This will upgrade the whole system, all packages build after that may be not
    compatible with those from the **NAOqi OS** on the robot.

Searching a package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Searching in the package name (quick search):

.. code-block:: console

    emerge -s <some package>

Searching in the package description (a lot slower):

.. code-block:: console

    emerge -S <some package>

.. _vm-usage-pkg-build:

Building and installing a package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build and install a package and all its dependencies, run (this requires root
privileges):

.. code-block:: console

    su
    emerge -ab <package name>
    exit

After the building and installing some packagea in the virtual machine, the
binary packages are locally stored in ``/home/nao/opennao-distro/packages``.

The following command will show you all built packages:

.. code-block:: console

    tree ``/home/nao/opennao-distro/packages``

.. _vm-usage-pkg-content:

Package content
+++++++++++++++

To check the content of an installed package:

.. code-block:: console

    equery files <package name>

To know which package a file belongs:

.. code-block:: console

    portageq owners / <full path of the file>
