Simulated robots
================

| A simulated robot is a virtual robot running on your computer.
| It allows you to test your code before running it on a real robot.
|

There are several ways to get to a simulated robot:

**Choregraphe** **virtual robot**      This robot is launched at **Choregraphe** startup and stopped at **Choregraphe** closure.

                                       It has the same abilities of a real one but:

                                       * It is not subjected to the gravity and its torso is always considered as in a straight position
                                         (exactly as it is displayed in the :ref:`3d-nao-panel`).
                                         So it cannot fall and cannot be lied down.

                                       * Its joints are always considered as stiffened and the stiffness can never be set off.

                                       * It has no audition functions (speech recognition, recording, etc).

                                       * It has no audio player functions.

                                       * It has no LED.

                                       * You cannot directly interact with it (tactile touch, bumper, etc), yet moving
                                         a joint in :ref:`3d-nao-panel` is possible.

                                       This simulated robot is dependent of **Choregraphe** and is not accessible from other applications
                                       such as **Monitor**.

**NAOqi binary**                       This robot has the same abilities as the previous one but is totally independent of
                                       **Choregraphe**.

                                       So it can be connected from any other application (**Monitor** for example)
                                       and can be launched and exited as you wish independently from **Choregraphe**.

**Virtual world**                      **Webots** offers a robot simulation in a customizable virtual world.

                                       For further details about the abilities of this simulated robot see :ref:`webots`.
