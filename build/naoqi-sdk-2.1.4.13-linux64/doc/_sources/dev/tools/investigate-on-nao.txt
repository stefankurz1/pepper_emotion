Debugging and investigating on the robot
==========================================

This section gives you some tips about debug and investigation methods on the robot.

Note that all the following is done logged over ssh on the robot.

For further details, see: :ref:`opennao-ssh`.

Debugging NAOqi development
---------------------------

Refer to :ref:`gdb`.


NAOqi issue report
------------------

Since the 1.14 release, a *issue report generator* is embedded in **NAOqi**.

When **NAOqi** ends prematurely in an unexpected way, an issue report is
generated in: ``/var/lib/minidump``.

To help us improving the software quality, feel free to send those reports to
**Aldebaran Robotics**.


Investigating system issues
---------------------------

In :term:`NAOqi OS`, several program generate logs that are stored in the ``/var/log``
directory or any of its sub-directories.

Because the ``/var/log`` directory is volatile, it is reset on each power-down.


Diagnosis and reports
---------------------

.. do we really need to talk about this?

   AFAIK, nao-diagnostic exists for a long (long) time but has never been
   documented because:
   - it is not really maintained
   - currently, we cannot ensure that there is no personal data among all the
     gathered stuff
   - it generates ~700KB tarball of compressed data, logs, etc... for which,
     there is currently no script processing those data.

In case of weird behavior of the robot, the ``nao-diagnostic`` program can gather
many data about the robot state into a tarball located by default in:
``/home/nao/diagnosis``.

To help us improving the software quality, feel free to send those diagnosis to
**Aldebaran Robotics**.
