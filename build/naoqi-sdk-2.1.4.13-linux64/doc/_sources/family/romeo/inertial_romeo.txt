|roboR| - Inertial unit **TBD**
================================

.. seealso:: :ref:`romeo`

--------------------

Specifications
--------------

The **Inertial unit** are made of:

- a 3-axis gyrometers with an angular speed of ~500Â°/s,

- a 3-axis accelerometer with an acceleration of ~2g.

Location
----------

The **Inertial unit** is located in the torso with its own processor.

Position relative to the **Torso** frame.

Output data
------------

The output data enables an estimation of the torso speed and attitude (Yaw, Pitch, Roll).

Compute Torso Angle Algorithm
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

An **Aldebaran Robotics** algorithm computing the torso Angle from accelerometers and
gyrometers is implemented inside the inertial board.

This algorithm used the good proprieties of each sensor: accelerometer is the
only absolute reference and give the good torso angle in static mode.
When some motion is detected, the output angle is computed with gyrometers
which have a good behavior in dynamic. However, integration of gyrometers
creates a bias of the compute angle, so in dynamic mode, a fusion of compute
angle from accelerometer and gyrometer is done to reduce this bias.
