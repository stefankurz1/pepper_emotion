ASK NAO Interface - V2 - Changelog
==================================

This is the new **ASK NAO Interface - V2** - https://interface2.asknao.com

It has been designed to support robots running on **NAOqi** version **2.1**.

If your robot is still running on version **1.14**, you can:

* Still access the former site https://interface.asknao.com/

Or better:

* upgrade your robot with version **2.1**, and then use the **ASK NAO Interface - V2**.

Global changes
--------------

* Uses the new **Aldebaran Store**:
  https://cloud.aldebaran-robotics.com

* No need to enter community login and password anymore, the system now uses **OAuth**
  authentication system.

  You are redirected to an authorization page the first time you log in, and you
  need to 'allow' **ASK NAO** to access your store account.

* In the **Aldebaran**  menu bar, a new page: **My Robots** lists
  the robots associated to your account, as well as robots shared by other
  users in your institution.

* Now robots can be associated to any **Teacher** or **Admin** account: they are
  automatically shared between institution members, so that every teacher can use them.

* Confirmation messages has been added everywhere (when a **Playlist** is saved,
  when a user profile is added/updated, etc.)

* Website loading time optimized.

* A link to **Ask NAO documentation** has been added in the **Aldebaran** menu bar.

* A notification system with a notification menu has been added on the main page.

  This menu displays notifications.
  
  Currently you will get notified everytime one of your robot updates or
  installs an application.
  You'll also get notified when the **ASK NAO interface** is updated.

* Website translated in Spanish and German.

Playlist tab changes
--------------------

* **Activity** information displays additional items about the application:
  version and tags.

* A Search box has been added to search for **Playlist** on the **Playlist** page.

* A search box has been added to search for **Activities** on the **Playlist** edition page.

* **Playlist** icon becomes dynamic, and displays the icons of the **Activity**
  included in the **Playlist**.

Create tab changes
------------------

  creator.
