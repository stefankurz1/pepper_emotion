--------------------

What it does
------------


**ALConnectionManager** provides methods to manage the network connectivity.
It contains commands allowing you to configure or connect a network,
but also to get the network properties or to create a network.

ALConnectionManager supports several technologies such as Ethernet, WiFi and Bluetooth.

The main features are:

- List available network services.

- Connect to a network service.

- Create a network service (supports WiFi Access Point and Bluetooth PAN).

- List available network technologies.

- Configure a network service.

This module gives access to useful information about the different network services,
such as the strength of a WiFi service, its current state or its security requirement.

This module notifies through events the changes about the network connectivity.

How it works
------------

**ALConnectionManager** is based on the open source software `ConnMan <http://www.connman.net>`_
to get information about all networks services and connecting to them.

**Aldebaran Robotics** is a contributor to the **ConnMan** project,
our ConnMan sources are hosted on github `<http://github.com/aldebaran>`_, only a
few patches differs from the official ConnMan version, our goal is to limit as much
as possible the differences between the two versions.

The WiFi services are handled by `WPA Supplicant <http://hostap.epitest.fi/wpa_supplicant/>`_.
The Bluetooth services are handled by `BlueZ <http://www.bluez.org>`_.

Performance and Limitations
---------------------------

**Limitation**

- ALConnectionManager is only available on the robot.

- ALConnectionManager currently doesn't support WPA entreprise security.

- The list of WiFi services are not available when the tethering mode is enabled.

- ALConnectionManager does not handle bluetooth devices pairing.

.. FIXME add a ref to bluetoothmanager (not coded yet)

Warning about tethering and security issue
------------------------------------------

The Tethering mode makes the robot acting as an Access Point, but it also shares your Internet connectivity.
If the robot is connected to a corporate network, you have to verify if this mode is compatible with your network security policy.

Getting Started
---------------

Essential information to deal with ALConnectionManager:

Services objects from **ConnectionManager** are represented as :ref:`networkinfo`.
