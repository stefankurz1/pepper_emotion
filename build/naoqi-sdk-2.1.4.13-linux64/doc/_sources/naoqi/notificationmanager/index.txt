--------------------

What it does
--------------

| The **ALNotificationManager** module provides methods to manage notifications on the robot.

What is a notification
+++++++++++++++++++++++

| A notification is a short message sent to the end-user by the robot system or by an application.
| For further details, see: :ref:`notification-alvalue`.

How it works
-------------

When an application sends a notification:

* It is appended to the list of pending notifications.

* The End user is informed that there is a pending notification and
  can ask the robot to read it.
  For further details, see:
  :ref:`notifications_nao`.

..  * |nao| :ref:`notifications_nao` or
..  * |juju| :ref:`notifications_juliette`.

The notification is removed from the list of pending notifications either when:

- it is read or
- it is removed by the application, for example if it is not valid anymore.

For further details about the objects supporting **ALNotificationManager**, see: :ref:`notificationInfo`.
