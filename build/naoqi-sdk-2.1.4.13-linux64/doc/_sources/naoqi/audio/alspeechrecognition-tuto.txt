ALSpeechRecognition Tutorial
============================

:ref:`naoqi-audio` - Overview | :ref:`API <alspeechrecognition-api>` | Tutorial

------------

This tutorial explains how to recognize words from vocabulary using the
embedded speech recognition.

.. note::

   All the examples provided are written in Python.

Creating a proxy on the module
------------------------------

Before using the ASR commands, you need to create a proxy on the ASR
module.

.. code-block:: guess

  # Creates a proxy on the speech-recognition module
  from naoqi import ALProxy

  IP = "<ROBOT_IP>"
  asr = ALProxy("ALSpeechRecognition", IP, 9559)

Changing the language of the speech recognition engine
------------------------------------------------------

The language of the speech recognition engine can be changed using the setLanguage function.
The list of the available languages can be obtained with the getAvailableLanguages function.

.. code-block:: python

  # Example: set the language of the speech recognition engine to English:
  asr.setLanguage("English")

Adding words to the vocabulary
------------------------------

You need to set the list of words that should be recognized by the speech recognition engine before you start recognition.
Word spotting is disabled by default when using function setWordListAsVocabulary.

.. code-block:: guess

  # Example: Adds "yes", "no" and "please" to the vocabulary
  vocabulary = ["yes", "no", "please"]
  asr.setVocabulary(vocabulary, False)
  # Or, if you want to enable word spotting:
  #asr.setVocabulary(vocabulary, True)


Starting and stopping the speech recognition engine
---------------------------------------------------

To start the speech recognition engine, you have to subscribe to the module.
You can stop it using the unsubscribe method.

.. code-block:: guess

  # Start the speech recognition engine with user Test_ASR
  asr.subscribe("Test_ASR")
  # Stop the speech recognition engine with user Test_ASR
  asr.unsubscribe("Test_ASR")
