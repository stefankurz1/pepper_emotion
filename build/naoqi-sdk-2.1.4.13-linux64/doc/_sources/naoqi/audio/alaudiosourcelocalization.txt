heard by the robot.

.. warning::

   .. deprecated:: 1.22
     this module has been re-factored and has changed name, so use the new
     :ref:`alsoundlocalization` module, which has the same API.

     For backward compatibility, the module **ALAudioSourceLocalization**
     is still supported. Please refer to the :ref:`alsoundlocalization-api`
     documentation, the only difference being the name of the event:

     - ALSoundLocalization/SoundLocated for **ALSoundLocalization**
     - ALAudioSourceLocalization/SoundLocated for **ALAudioSourceLocalization**
