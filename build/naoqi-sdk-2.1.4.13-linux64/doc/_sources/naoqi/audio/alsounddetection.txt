------------

What it does
------------

The **ALSoundDetection** module detects significative sounds in incoming audio
buffers.
This detection is based on the audio signal level and as such behaves
similarly on any type of sound (provided it is loud enough).

How it works
------------

The processing is made on the front microphone signal. The raw signal is first
smoothed by calculating the signal mean on a moving window.

A peak based detection is then applied on this averaged signal to provide the
user (through **ALMemory** in ``SoundDetected``) with the index of the detected sound start.

The end of that sound is eventually detected when the level of the averaged
signal comes back to its original value (before the peak detection).

The ``SoundDetected`` key shows from 1 to **n** sounds detected in the last audio buffer:

.. code-block:: guess

     [[index_1, type_1, confidence_1, time_1],
      ...,
     [index_n, type_n, confidence_n, time_n]]

**Where**:

- **index** is the indexes of starting and ending points of a detected sound.
- **type** contains 1 for starting point and 0 for ending point.
- **confidence** gives an estimate of the probability \[0;1] that the sound
  detected by the module corresponds to a real sound.
- **time** is the detection time in micro seconds.


Getting started
---------------

Using Choregraphe, the ``SoundDetected`` key can be retrieved and used (like any others)
as a stimulating input to any other box by right clicking on diagrams left border: **Add input from ALMemory**.
