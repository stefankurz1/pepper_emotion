ALRobotPosture API
====================

:ref:`Overview <alrobotposture>` | API

-----------------


Namespace : **AL**

.. code-block:: cpp

   #include <alproxies/alrobotpostureproxy.h>

Method list
-----------

As any module, this module inherits methods from :ref:`almodule-api`.
It also has the following specific methods:

.. cpp:class:: ALRobotPostureProxy

* :cpp:func:`ALRobotPostureProxy::getPostureList`
* :cpp:func:`ALRobotPostureProxy::getPosture`
* :cpp:func:`ALRobotPostureProxy::goToPosture`
* :cpp:func:`ALRobotPostureProxy::applyPosture`
* :cpp:func:`ALRobotPostureProxy::stopMove`

* :cpp:func:`ALRobotPostureProxy::getPostureFamily`
* :cpp:func:`ALRobotPostureProxy::getPostureFamilyList`
* :cpp:func:`ALRobotPostureProxy::setMaxTryNumber`

Event list
----------

* :naoqi:event:`PostureFamilyChanged`
* :naoqi:event:`PostureChanged`


Methods
-------

.. cpp:function:: std::vector<std::string> ALRobotPostureProxy::getPostureList()

  Returns a vector with all predefined postures.

  :return: A vector with all predefined postures.

.. cpp:function:: std::string ALRobotPostureProxy::getPosture()

  Returns the name of the current :term:`predefined postures`. If the current posture is not in the predefined postures, it returns "Unknown".

  :return: A string with the name of the current posture.


.. cpp:function:: bool ALRobotPostureProxy::goToPosture(const std::string postureName, const float speed)

  Makes the robot go to the predefined posture asked in parameter. It is possible to modify
  the speed of the move. The move is "intelligent": it will start from beginning posture of the robot, and choose
  all the steps to reach the asked posture.

  This is a blocking call. Use a post if you want to make it non-blocking.

  :param postureName: Name of the predefined posture to be reached. See: :term:`Predefined postures`.

  :param speed: Relative speed between 0.0 and 1.0.

  :return: Returns if the predefined posture was reached.


.. cpp:function:: bool ALRobotPostureProxy::applyPosture(const std::string &postureName, const float& speed)

  Set all the joints of the robot in the configuration of the asked predefined posture.

  Use applyPosture for animation purposes when manipulating the robot. Consider it has a shortcut, in case you
  want to reach quickly a posture. The robot will need user's help to reach the posture.

  The effect is immediate and there is no intelligence in it so be careful
  when using set posture. For example if the robot is sitting and you ask for
  setPosture("StandInit", 1.0) it can be dangerous for the robot, it will fall
  if you do not help it to stand up.

  If you want the robot to stand up alone, use :cpp:func:`ALRobotPostureProxy::goToPosture`.

  This is a blocking call. Please use a post if you want to make it non-blocking.

  :param postureName: Name of the predefined posture to be reached. See: :term:`Predefined postures`.

  :param speed: Relative speed between 0.0 and 1.0.

  :return: Returns if the predefined posture was reached.


.. cpp:function:: void ALRobotPostureProxy::stopMove()

  Stop the current posture interpolation.



.. cpp:function:: std::string ALRobotPostureProxy::getPostureFamily()

  Returns the Posture family. For further details, see: :term:`Posture family`.

  :return: Returns the name of the current posture family.



.. cpp:function:: std::vector<std::string> ALRobotPostureProxy::getPostureFamilyList()

  Returns a vector with all predefined postures families.

  :return: A vector with all predefined postures families.



.. cpp:function:: void ALRobotPostureProxy::setMaxTryNumber( const int& maxTryNumber)

  Sets the maximum number of tries performed by :cpp:func:`ALRobotPostureProxy::goToPosture`
  before returning a fail.

  :param maxTryNumber: number of tries, default value: 3.



Events
------

.. naoqi:event:: PostureFamilyChanged(std::string PostureFamily)

  Raises the name of the :term:`Posture family` when it changes.

  The update frequency of the event is about 1 second.

.. naoqi:event:: PostureChanged(std::string Posture)

  Raises the name of the :term:`Posture` when it changes.

  The update frequency of the event is about 1 second.
