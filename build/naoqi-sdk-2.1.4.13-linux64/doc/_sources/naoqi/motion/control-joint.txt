:ref:`naoqi-motion` - Overview | :ref:`API <control-joint-api>` | :ref:`Tutorial <control-joint-tuto>`

------------


What it does
------------

| These API are dedicated to control directly the position of the robot joints.
| Each joint can be controlled individually, or in parallel with other joints.

There are two ways of controlling a joint or a group of joints:
  * animation methods (time fixed, blocking function)
      * :cpp:func:`ALMotionProxy::angleInterpolation`
      * :cpp:func:`ALMotionProxy::angleInterpolationWithSpeed`
  * reactive methods (could be changed every **ALMotion** cycle, non blocking function)
      * :cpp:func:`ALMotionProxy::setAngles`
      * :cpp:func:`ALMotionProxy::changeAngles`

How it works
------------

These API just create a higher level of the :term:`DCM` actuator control and provide
interpolation to have more smooth behavior.

Getting started
---------------

.. _body-chain-def:

"Body", chains and joint names
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Joints can be controlled:

* individually, using a joint name, or
* in parallel, using a chain of joints or a group of joints like "Body".

For further details, see: :ref:`NAO's Chains<nao_chains>`.

It is possible to get the list of joints available on your robot using the
:cpp:func:`ALMotionProxy::getBodyNames` method, described in the section:
:ref:`general-tools::jointNames`.

Use Cases
---------

Case 1: Controlling Joints
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To control a joint, you need to specify the name of the joint, the
target angle in radians, and how fast you want to go to the target angle.

Case 2: Timed Interpolations
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When you know in advance the trajectory that you want to follow,
the :cpp:func:`ALMotionProxy::angleInterpolation` and :cpp:func:`ALMotionProxy::angleInterpolationWithSpeed` methods can be
used to set up an interpolation.

.. code-block:: python

  # Example showing a joint trajectory with a single destination
  names = "HeadYaw"
  angleLists = 1.0
  times = 1.0
  isAbsolute = True
  proxy.angleInterpolation(names, angleLists, times, isAbsolute)

You can command multiple joints in one command, by using a single
time, and a number of target angles equal to the number of joints.

.. code-block:: python

  # Example showing a command for the two joints in the 'Head' alias
  # 'Head' is expanded to ['HeadYaw','HeadPitch']
  names = "Head"
  angleLists = [-1.0,-1.0]
  times = 1.0
  isAbsolute = True
  proxy.angleInterpolation(names, angleLists, times, isAbsolute)

The same command can take a list of angles with corresponding times.

.. code-block:: python

  # Shake the head from side to side
  names = "HeadYaw"
  angleLists = [1.0, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0, 0.0]
  times      = [1.0,  2.0, 3.0,  4.0, 5.0]
  isAbsolute = True
  proxy.angleInterpolation(names, angleLists, times, isAbsolute)

Similarly, trajectories can be specified for multiple joints.

.. code-block:: python

  # Two trajectories in one command. Each trajectory must have a
  # corresponding number of times
  names      = ["HeadYaw", "HeadPitch"]
  angleLists = [[1.0, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0], [-1.0]]
  times      = [[1.0,  2.0, 3.0,  4.0], [ 5.0]]
  isAbsolute = True
  proxy.angleInterpolation(names, angleLists, times, isAbsolute)

Case 3: Reactive Control
++++++++++++++++++++++++

The commands :cpp:func:`ALMotionProxy::setAngles` and :cpp:func:`ALMotionProxy::changeAngles`, do not block the calling thread.
This makes them ideal for being called often in reactive control loops, such as
head tracking. You can call them often, with contradictory commands, and motion will
ensure that the trajectory is smooth in position and continuous in velocity.

It is also possible to use time with angleInterpolation to do reactive control.
