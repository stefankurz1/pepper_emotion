What it does
------------

The **Push recovery** is a reflex dedicated to prevent the fall of the robot,
using information provided by its :ref:`gyrometers <juliette-inertial>`
and wheel velocities.

The principle is to compensate the tilt of the robot when anything or anyone
pushes the robot. If it can be stabilized by itself, it will use its joints and
the acceleration of its wheels to prevent the fall.

If it can't be stabilized by itself (the tilt angle is too high or the angular
velocity reaches a defined limit), the fall manager will be triggered.
Even if the fall manager is deactivated, the **push recovery**
will stop if the same condition occurs.


How it works
------------

The **Push recovery** reflex is enabled by default when **NAOqi** is running.

It can be triggered  any time, even during the execution of a movement or of a
**Timeline**, except when:

* the :term:`power hatch` is opened, or
* the robot is in a resting posture.

It is possible to deactivate manually the **push recovery** using the procedure
described here: :ref:`reflex-deactivation`.

**Related events**:

* :naoqi:event:`ALMotion/Safety/RobotPushed` is sent when the robot has detected
  a push.

* :naoqi:event:`ALMotion/Safety/PushRecovery` is sent when the robot needs to
  move in order to recover from disturbance.
