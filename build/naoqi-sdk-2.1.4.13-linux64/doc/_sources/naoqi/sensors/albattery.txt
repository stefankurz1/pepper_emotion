What it does
------------

**ALBattery** is responsible for raising events related to the robot battery hardware.

For further details, see section: :ref:`ALBattery list of events <albattery-event-list>`.

How it works
------------

ALBattery retrieves battery data from ALMemory, processes it and raises
events according to the situation.

Performance and Limitations
---------------------------

Remaining time
++++++++++++++

When a ``BatteryLow`` event is raised, the remaining time depends on the use that is
made of the robot:

- when sitting, a few minutes of battery might remain,
- when walking battery could be empty within 30 seconds.

Use Cases
---------

Detect that the battery is low so as to warn the user.
