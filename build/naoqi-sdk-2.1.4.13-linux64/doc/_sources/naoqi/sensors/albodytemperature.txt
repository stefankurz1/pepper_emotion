:ref:`naoqi-sensors` - Overview | :ref:`API <albodytemperature-api>`

--------

What it does
------------

**ALBodyTemperature** is responsible for raising events when some part of the
hardware, able to overheat, has reach a concerning level of temperature.

It could be:

* Joints or Actuators,
* CPU,
* Battery.

How it works
------------

CPU - Temperature
+++++++++++++++++

**ALBodyTemperature** retrieves temperature information from the CPU hardware and
publish it in **ALMemory key**: Device/SubDeviceList/Head/Temperature/Sensor/Value.

For further details, see: :ref:`Cpu`.

Joint, Actuator and Battery Temperature
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**ALBodyTemperature** retrieves temperature information from the
:term:`Temperature status` of the Joints, the Actuators, and the Battery.
If at least one of item has a non null status, an :naoqi:event:`HotDeviceDetected`
event is raised.

For further details about the temperature automatic limitation, see: :term:`Temperature status`.

Notification
++++++++++++

If one Joint, one Actuator or the battery is hot
(non null :term:`Temperature status`), a notification is sent.

For further details about the temperature notification, see:
:ref:`notif_warning_diagnosis`.

The notification can be disabled using :cpp:func:`ALBodyTemperatureProxy::setEnableNotifications`

.. _albodytemperature_diagnosis:

Temperature Diagnosis
+++++++++++++++++++++

**ALBodyTemperature** generates a diagnosis based on the :term:`Temperature status`
but with a threshold as shown on the figure below:

    :width: 573 px
    :height: 357 px

**Result**

Based on this diagnosis, :ref:`almemory` error keys are updated for each joint or actuator,
the key format is: Diagnosis/Temperature/*JointName*/Error.
For further details see **Diagnosis keys** in: :ref:`actuator_sensor_list_nao`.

.. or :ref:`actuator_sensor_list_juliette`.

A summary of the temperature diagnosis is available using
:cpp:func:`ALBodyTemperatureProxy::getTemperatureDiagnosis`

**Effect**

This temperature diagnosis has the same behavior than the passive diagnosis (see :ref:`aldiagnosis`)
and if the :term:`Level of failure severity` requires it, **ALMotion** module reacts in order to
protect the robot and the user.

For further details about the motion diagnosis reflexes, see: :ref:`reflexes-diagnosis`.

Use Cases
---------

It allows you to be notified if the temperature of a joint
reaches the limit triggering an automatic limitation of the **Stiffness**.
