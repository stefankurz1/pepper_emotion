What it does
------------

The **ALTouch** module generates the event :naoqi:event:`TouchChanged` whenever
the robot is touched.

The event :naoqi:event:`TouchChanged` gives you a list of AL::ALValue with a body part
and a boolean for the touch status.

For example:

- [["Head/Touch/Middle", ``True``], ["ChestBoard/Button", ``True``]]
- [["Head/Touch/Middle", ``False``]]
- [["LArm", ``True``], ["RHand", ``False``]]

How it works
------------

The aim of these sensors is to determine whether the robot is touched.
It's a bistable behavior, an event is raised when for example the head is touched with the value
``True`` then an other one when the head is not touch anymore with the value ``False``.

For the button [tactile, bumper, chest ...], the value is read in the ALMemory and if the status
changed, an event is raised. For body parts that do not have capacitive sensors, touch is detected
by a difference between joint angle commands and sensor.

Making a Python module - Reacting to Touch
==========================================

The example below is a NAOqi Python module that reacts to touch events.
