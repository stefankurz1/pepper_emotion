What it does
------------

The **ALFSR** module generates the event :naoqi:event:`footContactChanged` whenever
the foot contact changes.

- If the **Aldebaran** robot has at least one foot on the ground, the event is raised with the value ``True``
- If the **Aldebaran** robot has no feet on the ground, the event is raised with the value ``False``

The module also generates several values in :ref:`ALMemory <almemory>`:
:naoqi:memkey:`footContact`,
:naoqi:memkey:`leftFootContact`,
:naoqi:memkey:`rightFootContact`,
:naoqi:memkey:`leftFootTotalWeight`,
:naoqi:memkey:`rightFootTotalWeight`.

How it works
------------

**NAO** has four :ref:`robot-fsr` under each foot.

The aim of these sensors is to determine whether the **Aldebaran** robot's feet are touching
the ground or not. This information is used during the walk, where at least
one foot must maintain contact with the ground while walking, otherwise the
walk is stopped.

For more details, see :ref:`motion-kill-walk-when-lifted`.

Performances and Limitations
----------------------------

The value returned by :naoqi:memkey:`leftFootTotalWeight` and
:naoqi:memkey:`rightFootTotalWeight` is not accurate enough to be meaningful,
only the difference between two successive values has an interest.
