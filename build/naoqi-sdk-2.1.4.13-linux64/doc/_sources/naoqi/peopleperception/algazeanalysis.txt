What it does
------------

**ALGazeAnalysis** allows you to analyze the direction of the gaze of a detected person,
in order to know if he/she is looking at the robot. It also detects whether the person's eyes
are open or close.


How it works
------------

By detecting the face of a person and studying its orientation, it is possible to detect whether
or not this person is looking at the robot.

First a scoring value, called **LookingAtRobotScore**, is computed for each person in the detected population.
This score, between 0 and 1, describes the confidence in the fact that the person is looking at the robot. It is
stored in the memory key :naoqi:memkey:`PeoplePerception/Person/<ID>/LookingAtRobotScore`.
Then this score is compared to a threshold value:

* if the score is greater than the threshold value, the person is characterized
  as looking at the robot.
* if the score is smaller than the threshold value, the person is characterized
  as not looking at the robot.

It is possible to change the threshold value by changing the Tolerance of the gaze analysis, using
the function :cpp:func:`ALGazeAnalysisProxy::setTolerance` (Threshold = 1-Tolerance). The current
value of the Tolerance can be retrieved with function :cpp:func:`ALGazeAnalysisProxy::getTolerance`.

This result is added to the description of the people in the **ALMemory**
by filling the key :naoqi:memkey:`PeoplePerception/Person/<ID>/IsLookingAtRobot`.

The raw head angles are also available through the key :naoqi:memkey:`PeoplePerception/Person/<ID>/HeadAngles`.
The gaze direction *relative to the face plane* are available through :naoqi:memkey:`PeoplePerception/Person/<ID>/GazeDirection`.
The "opening degree" of both eyes is given by :naoqi:memkey:`PeoplePerception/Person/<ID>/EyeOpeningDegree`.
