:ref:`naoqi-peopleperception` - Overview | :ref:`API <alfacecharacteristics-api>`

------------

What it does
------------

**ALFaceCharacteristics** updates every person with some additional information
such as an estimation of age and gender. It also tries and detects whether the
person is smiling or what facial expression the person is having.


How it works
------------

Like most perception modules this one works on top of **ALPeoplePerception** which
will be started automatically by **ALFaceCharacteristics**.

This module analyzes the face of a person and try to find some specific characteristics
to a gender or an age category. As for the smile, it gives a measurement of the
"smile degree" on a face, which means it can make the difference between a faint smile
and a frank smile. An event called :naoqi:event:`FaceCharacteristics/PersonSmiling`
is raised every time the smile degree is higher than a given threshold. The
value of this threshold can be changed by calling
:cpp:func:`ALFaceCharacteristicsProxy::setSmilingThreshold`.

**ALFaceCharacteristics** also analyses facial expressions and tries to estimate
whether a face is *neutral*, *happy*, *surprised*, *angry* or *sad*.

In addition to the age, gender, smile and facial expression estimations, the module also provides
a confidence score between 0 and 1 associated to each value to indicate how likely
an estimation is. 0 means that the estimation is "very unlikely" and 1 means "very likely").
It makes it possible to filter the results in order to keep the most reliable information
only.

Performances and limitations
----------------------------

* Lighting conditions and accessories such as glasses and hat may alter the results.
* Face deformations (such as a pronounced grin or grimace) can also have an impact on
  age estimation.
* Gender estimation on young children may also be less accurate than on adults since
  they have less distinctive facial features.
* The estimation results may fluctuate over time because they are computed on different
  facial images each time. This is to be expected and the age estimation for example
  can be used to estimate an "age category" (child/adult/elderly for example).
* Facial expression estimation is not able to recognize too subtle facial expressions.
