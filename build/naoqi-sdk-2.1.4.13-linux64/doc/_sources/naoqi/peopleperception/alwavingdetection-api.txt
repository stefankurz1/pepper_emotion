ALWavingDetection API
=====================

:ref:`naoqi-peopleperception` - :ref:`Overview <alwavingdetection>` | API

--------

|3d| This module requires a robot with a 3D sensor.


Namespace : **AL**

.. code-block:: cpp

  #include <alproxies/alwavingdetectionproxy.h>




Method list
-----------

.. cpp:class:: ALWavingDetectionProxy

* As any module, this module inherits methods from :ref:`almodule-api`.

* It also inherits methods from :ref:`alextractor-api`.

* And has the following specific methods:

  * :cpp:func:`ALWavingDetectionProxy::getMaxDistance`
  * :cpp:func:`ALWavingDetectionProxy::getMinSize`
  * :cpp:func:`ALWavingDetectionProxy::setMaxDistance`
  * :cpp:func:`ALWavingDetectionProxy::setMinSize`



Event list
----------

* :naoqi:event:`WavingDetection/PersonWaving`
* :naoqi:event:`WavingDetection/PersonWavingCenter`
* :naoqi:event:`WavingDetection/PersonWavingLeft`
* :naoqi:event:`WavingDetection/PersonWavingRight`


ALMemory Key list

Methods
-------

.. cpp:function:: float ALWavingDetectionProxy::getMaxDistance()

   :return: The current value of MaxDistance (in meters). The default value is 2.5m. Please refer to :ref:`alwavingdetection` for details.

.. cpp:function:: float ALWavingDetectionProxy::getMinSize()

   :return: The current value of MinSize (in meters). The default value is 0.1m. Please refer to :ref:`alwavingdetection` for details.


.. cpp:function:: bool ALWavingDetectionProxy::setMaxDistance(const float& distance)

   Sets the value of MaxDistance. Please refer to :ref:`alwavingdetection` for details.

   :param distance: Value of the new MaxDistance (in meters). It must be between 0.5 and 3 meters.

   :return: true if the update succeeded.

.. cpp:function:: bool ALWavingDetectionProxy::setMinSize(const float& size)

   Sets the value of MinSize. Please refer to :ref:`alwavingdetection` for details.

   :param size: Value of the new MinSize (in meters). It must be between 0.05 and 0.3 meter.

   :return: true if the update succeeded.


Events
------

.. naoqi:event:: WavingDetection/PersonWaving(int id)

  Raised when someone just waved at the robot.

  :param id: ID of the person.

.. naoqi:event:: WavingDetection/PersonWavingCenter(int id)

  Raised when someone just waved at the robot and the waving was detected ahead of the person.
  The most usual case is when the person waved with one of his/hers arm, but it has not
  been possible to detect which arm he/she was using.

  :param id: ID of the person.

.. naoqi:event:: WavingDetection/PersonWavingLeft(int id)

  Raised when someone just waved at the robot and the waving was detected on the left size of the person.
  The most usual case is when the person waved with his/her left arm.

  :param id: ID of the person.

.. naoqi:event:: WavingDetection/PersonWavingRight(int id)

  Raised when someone just waved at the robot and the waving was detected on the right size of the person.
  The most usual case is when the person waved with his/her right arm.

  :param id: ID of the person.


ALMemory Keys
-------------

.. naoqi:memkey:: bool PeoplePerception/Person/<ID>/IsWaving

  Says whether or not the person is waving at the robot. To have more information about
  the waving and its position with respect to the body of the person, it is possible
  to use the 3 next keys: IsWavingLeft, IsWavingRight and IsWavingCenter.
  <ID> is the ID of the person (see :ref:`ALPeoplePerception API <alpeopleperception-api>`).

.. naoqi:memkey:: bool PeoplePerception/Person/<ID>/IsWavingCenter

  Is set to true when some movements have been detected ahead of the body of the person.
  The most usual case is when the person is waving with one of his/her arms, but it has not
  been possible to detect which arm he/she was using.
  <ID> is the ID of the person (see :ref:`ALPeoplePerception API <alpeopleperception-api>`).

.. naoqi:memkey:: bool PeoplePerception/Person/<ID>/IsWavingLeft

  Is set to true when some movements have been detected on the left size of the person.
  The most usual case is when the person is waving with his/her left arm.
  <ID> is the ID of the person (see :ref:`ALPeoplePerception API <alpeopleperception-api>`).

.. naoqi:memkey:: bool PeoplePerception/Person/<ID>/IsWavingRight

  Is set to true when some movements have been detected on the right size of the person.
  The most usual case is when the person is waving with his/her right arm.
  <ID> is the ID of the person (see :ref:`ALPeoplePerception API <alpeopleperception-api>`).
