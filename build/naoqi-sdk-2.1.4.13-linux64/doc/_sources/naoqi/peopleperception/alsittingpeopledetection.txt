------------

What it does
------------

**ALSittingPeopleDetection** updates every person with the information of whether
he or she is sitting (on a chair for example) or standing.


How it works
------------

The distinction between sitting and standing positions is based on the head position
relative to the ground. If the head is found to be higher than a given threshold
then the corresponding person will be detected as standing. Otherwise, he or she
will be considered as sitting.


Performances and limitations
----------------------------

* This module considers that the robot is on the ground. If it is not the case, the threshold value should take the robots elevation into account.
* This module cannot make the difference between small people (children for instance) and sitting people.
