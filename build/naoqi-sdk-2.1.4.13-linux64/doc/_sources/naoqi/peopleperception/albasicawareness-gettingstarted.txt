ALBasicAwareness - Getting Started
==================================

:ref:`naoqi-peopleperception` - :ref:`Overview <albasicawareness>` | :ref:`API <albasicawareness-api>`
| Getting Started

-------------


A simple example
----------------

Here we just start and stop BasicAwareness.

Detect someone, track and get information about them
----------------------------------------------------

In some cases we want to trigger an action when a person is found,
and then keep focused on this person. The FullyEngaged mode suits this need,
as it can detect someone and keep engaged with them. We know that the robot has
found (or lost) someone by catching the events ALBasicAwareness/HumanTracked
and ALBasicAwareness/PeopleLeft
(see the :ref:`event handling tutorial<python-reacting-to-events>`).
It is then possible to trigger an action: in our example we start or stop speech
recognition, then we get some information related to the tracked person from
PeoplePerception and print them.
