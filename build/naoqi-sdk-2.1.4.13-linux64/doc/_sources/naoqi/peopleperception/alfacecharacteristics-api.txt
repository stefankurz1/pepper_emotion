=========================

:ref:`naoqi-peopleperception` - :ref:`Overview <alfacecharacteristics>` | API

--------

Namespace : **AL**

.. code-block:: cpp

  #include <alproxies/alfacecharacteristicsproxy.h>


Method list
-----------

.. cpp:class:: ALFaceCharacteristicsProxy

* As any module, this module inherits methods from :ref:`almodule-api`.

* It also inherits methods from :ref:`alextractor-api`.

* It also has the following specific methods:

  * :cpp:func:`ALFaceCharacteristicsProxy::analyzeFaceCharacteristics`
  * :cpp:func:`ALFaceCharacteristicsProxy::getSmilingThreshold`
  * :cpp:func:`ALFaceCharacteristicsProxy::setSmilingThreshold`


Event list
----------

* :naoqi:event:`FaceCharacteristics/PersonSmiling`


ALMemory Key list
-----------------

* :naoqi:memkey:`PeoplePerception/Person/<ID>/AgeProperties`
* :naoqi:memkey:`PeoplePerception/Person/<ID>/ExpressionProperties`
* :naoqi:memkey:`PeoplePerception/Person/<ID>/GenderProperties`
* :naoqi:memkey:`PeoplePerception/Person/<ID>/SmileProperties`


Methods
-------

.. cpp:function:: bool ALFaceCharacteristicsProxy::analyzeFaceCharacteristics(int id)

  Performs the face analysis on a given person using the ID. This method can be called
  even if **ALFaceCharacteristics** is not running in order to update the ALMemory data
  of this person only.

  :param id: ID of the person that should be analyzed.

  :returns: true if the analysis succeeded and false if something went wrong or if
            the ID is invalid.


.. cpp:function:: float ALFaceCharacteristicsProxy::getSmilingThreshold()

  Returns the current smiling threshold value above which the event
  :naoqi:event:`FaceCharacteristics/PersonSmiling` is raised.

  :returns: threshold value between 0 and 1 (default = 0.7).


.. cpp:function:: void ALFaceCharacteristicsProxy::setSmilingThreshold(float threshold)

  Sets the current smiling threshold value.

  :param threshold: New threshold value. It must be between 0 and 1.

Events
------

.. naoqi:event:: FaceCharacteristics/PersonSmiling(int id)

  Raised when a person has a smile value above the current threshold (default = 0.7).

  :param id: ID of the person as defined by the :ref:`alpeopleperception-api`.


ALMemory Keys
-------------

.. naoqi:memkey:: AL::ALValue PeoplePerception/Person/<ID>/AgeProperties

  Age estimation of a person in the form [age, confidence]. The age is limited to
  the interval [0, 75] and the confidence is in [0, 1].

  | **<ID>** is the ID of the person as defined by the :ref:`alpeopleperception-api`.
  | See also: :naoqi:event:`PeoplePerception/PeopleList`.

.. naoqi:memkey:: AL::ALValue PeoplePerception/Person/<ID>/ExpressionProperties

  Estimation of the facial expression on a person's face. The associated data is
  an array containing the detection score of the following five expressions:
  [*neutral*, *happy*, *surprised*, *angry* or *sad*].

  Each score ranges from 0 and 1 and represents the probability that the person
  expresses the corresponding expression. As such, the sum of all five properties
  is equal to 1, except if the detection failed (in that case all five values are
  set to zero).

.. naoqi:memkey:: AL::ALValue PeoplePerception/Person/<ID>/GenderProperties

  Gender estimation of a person in the form [gender, confidence]. Gender is either
  0 for female or 1 for male and the confidence is in [0, 1].

.. naoqi:memkey:: AL::ALValue PeoplePerception/Person/<ID>/SmileProperties

  Smile degree estimation of a person in the form [smile degree, confidence].
  The smile degree is a floating point value between 0 and 1 where 0 means "no smile"
  and 1 is a large smile. The confidence is in [0, 1].
