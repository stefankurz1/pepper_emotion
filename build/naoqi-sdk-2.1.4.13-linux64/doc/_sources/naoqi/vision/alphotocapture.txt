What it does
------------

The **ALPhotoCapture** module allows you to take pictures and using the robot
cameras and save them on disk.

TakePicture
+++++++++++

This function takes and stores one picture using the module's parameters
(color space, frame rate, resolution, picture format). All these parameters can
be set using the appropriate methods (see the :ref:`API <alvideorecorder-api>`
section).
The location of the file on the disk is given as argument.
.. note::

   A button is available in the Monitor GUI for taking pictures by calling this
   function.


TakePictures
++++++++++++

This function is similar to :cpp:func:`ALPhotoCaptureProxy::takePicture` but allows to take several
pictures. The final file names are constructed by appending the number of the
picture to the file name.


.. note::

   If you don't manually set the parameters, the following ones will be used by
   default:

   * Camera ID: default (top camera)
   * Color space: BGR
   * Time between two pictures: 200 millisecond (*i.e.* 5 frames per second)
   * Resolution: VGA (640 x 480)
   * Picture format: jpg

Performances and Limitations
----------------------------

A call to :cpp:func:`ALPhotoCaptureProxy::takePicture` or :cpp:func:`ALPhotoCaptureProxy::takePictures`
takes some time because the module has to subscribe to **ALVideoDevice** and wait a few hundred milliseconds
for the camera image to stabilize. However, if you need reactivity it is possible to subscribe to
**ALVideoDevice** before taking the picture(s), thus saving up to a second or more. This is done by
calling the method :cpp:func:`ALPhotoCaptureProxy::halfPress`. A second call will cause the module
to unsubscribe from **ALVideoDevice**.

.. note::

   Please note that no change in camera ID, color space, time period, resolution will be taken into account
   when the *halfPress* mode is on. You have to turn it off and on again for the new settings to be applied.

.. warning::

   Be careful when turning this mode on especially if the requested resolution is high, for it might affect
   performance of all other modules which get data from **ALVideoDevice**. It is advised to turn the *halfPress*
   mode off as soon as it is not needed anymore.

Getting started
---------------

The easiest way to get started with most of these features is to use the corresponding Choregraphe vision boxes.
Recording capabilities can be easily used through the camera panel of Monitor.
You will also find working examples on the :ref:`Tutorial <alphotocapture-tuto>` page.
