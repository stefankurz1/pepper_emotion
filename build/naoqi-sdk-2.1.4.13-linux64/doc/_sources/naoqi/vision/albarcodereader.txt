-------------------

What it does
------------

**ALBarcodeReader** scans an image from the camera and looks for a barcode. If
a barcode is found in the image, the module tries to decypher it.


How it works
------------

**ALBarcodeReader** is a module that regularly queries an image
from the camera, converts it to grayscale and processes it in order to
find and decode barcodes.

An event is raised whenever a code is read. This event also contains the code
data and corner position as depicted in the above image. Note that the first
corner (labelled "0") is always opposite to the corner with no black square. The
remaining corners are labelled counter-clockwise.

See :naoqi:event:`BarcodeReader/BarcodeDetected` for a detailed
event data description.


Performances and limitations
----------------------------

**ALBarcodeReader** currently only works with QR Codes. Several codes can be
processed in a single image.

Since a barcode is made of small elements (bars, squares...), the image resolution
must be set according to the distance between the camera and the code itself.
The detection rate also depends on the printed code quality and size.
