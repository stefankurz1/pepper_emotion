What it does
------------

The **ALVideoRecorder** module allows you to record video sequences using the
robot cameras and save them on disk.

StartRecording and StopRecording
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

These two functions are used to record videos on the robot.

They are quite straightforward to use. Just call :cpp:func:`ALVideoRecorderProxy::startRecording`
passing the video name as argument. The robot will then start to record what it
can see with its active camera. The record is done using the module's parameters
(color space, frame rate, resolution, video format). All these parameters can
be set using the appropriate methods (see the :ref:`API <alvideorecorder-api>`
section).
Please note that the frame rate may go down below the specified value depending
on what is running on the robot.

.. note::

  startRecording is not a blocking function, it launches a separate thread that
  performs the video recording.

When you want to stop the record, call :cpp:func:`ALVideoRecorderProxy::stopRecording`.
The record is then saved on the robot in using the file path and name you
specified.

.. warning::

  Please note that you can only have one active record at a time. If you want to
  know if there is an active record, you can call
  :cpp:func:`ALVideoRecorderProxy::isRecording`.

.. note::

   If you don't manually set the parameters, the following ones will be used by
   default:

   * Color space: BGR
   * Frame rate: 15 frames per second (FPS)
   * Resolution: QVGA (320 x 240)
   * Video format: MJPG

Performances and limitations
----------------------------

Depending on the video format used for encoding, the video stream can either be
compressed or uncompressed. Uncompressed video has a limited impact on the CPU
but produces quite large video files (500MB for a 5-minute video at 10 FPS and
VGA resolution).

On the contrary, compressed video takes much smaller disk space but requires more
processing power. Depending on the CPU load at the moment of recording, the required
frame rate may not be reached. On the current hardware, it is not possible to
record a VGA compressed video (MJPG for example) at 30 FPS. As a result,
**ALVideoRecorder** will automatically limit the recording frame rate to 15 FPS
in VGA resolution.


.. note::

  A video recorded with MJPG or IYUV format will be stored in an AVI container.
  As a result, the file name will end with ".avi".

.. warning::

  Recording a gray scale video in IYUV is not possible. Either switch to a color
  video or to another video format (MJPG).

Getting started
---------------

The easiest way to get started with most of these features is to use the
corresponding Choregraphe vision boxes. Recording capabilities can be easily
used through the camera panel of Monitor. You will also find working examples
on the :ref:`Tutorial <alvideorecorder-tuto>` page.

Video recording can also be quickly accessed using Monitor, which internally uses
**ALVideoRecorder**'s functions.
