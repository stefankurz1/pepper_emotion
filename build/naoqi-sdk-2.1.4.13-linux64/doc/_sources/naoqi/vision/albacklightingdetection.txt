-------------------

What it does
------------

**ALBacklightingDetection** extractor checks if the images returned by the
camera are backlit or not. Backlighting occurs when there is high contrast
between a light source (e.g. a window) and the observed scene.

The following backlighting value is computed for each frame:

* 0: no backlight
* 1: possible backlight
* 2: backlight identified

This value is stored in the **ALMemory**. When a backlighting situation is
detected for the first time (i.e the backlighting value just turned to 2)
an event is raised.

How it works
------------

In order to compute the backlighting value, the extractor:

#. analyses in the current frame if more than 2% of pixels are clipped
   (a phenomenon that occurs when a pixel sensor receives more light that it can "store",
   resulting in a '255' value after digital conversion for that pixel).

#. checks if more than 60% of pixels present a luminance below '70'.

The final result is a weighted combination of both the percentage
of pixels at '255' and the percentage of pixels below '70'.


Performances and Limitations
----------------------------

The camera AutoExposition parameter (and the AutoGain parameter, if it exists)
of the camera must be activated for this module to work properly.
