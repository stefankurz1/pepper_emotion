-------------------

What it does
------------

**ALDarknessDetection** enables to check whether or not the robot
is in a dark environment.

A darkness value is computed for each frame returned by the camera.
This value is stored in the **ALMemory**.  When the robot detects
for the first time that that the environment around it is dark
(i.e the darkness value is greater than a threshold) an event is raised.

How it works
------------

This function first computes a value between 0 and 100 corresponding
to the lighting conditions of the environment around the robot:

* 0: bright environment
* 100: dark environment

This value is then compared to a darkness threshold:

* if it is smaller than the threshold, the surrounding environment
  is not considered as dark.
* if it is greater than the threshold, the surrounding environment
  is considered as dark.

The darkness threshold value can be accessed with the function
:cpp:func:`ALDarknessDetectionProxy::getDarknessThreshold`.
It has a default value of 60 but it can be changed with
the function :cpp:func:`ALDarknessDetectionProxy::setDarknessThreshold`.


Performances and Limitations
----------------------------

The camera AutoExposition parameter (and the AutoGain parameter, if it exists)
of the camera must be activated for this module to work properly.
