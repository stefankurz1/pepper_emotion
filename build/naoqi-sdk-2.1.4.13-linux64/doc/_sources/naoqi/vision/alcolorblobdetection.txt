:ref:`naoqi-vision` - Overview | :ref:`API <alcolorblobdetection-api>`

-----------------


What it does
------------

**ALColorBlobDetection** is a module that provides a fast 2D vision-based color blob detector.


How it works
------------

**ALColorBlobDetection** is based on a fast search for a set of pixels of a given color (within a certain threshold).
The color and its threhsold can be chosen. Similarly, the object span and its minimum size can be defined.

The output is an ALTracker event as defined at :ref:`altracker-api`.

Performances and Limitations
----------------------------

The detection works faster than the red ball detector and should be used instead. The color has to be provided through
the API as there is no default value.
