What it does
------------

**ALAutonomousLife** is the module that makes the robot be alive at all time.

For further details, see: |nao| :ref:`nao_life`.

How it works
-------------

* The robot is kept visually alive by using the :ref:`albasicawareness` and
  :ref:`almotion` :ref:`idle` services.

* :ref:`Activities <activity>` are autonomously started when their specific 
  :ref:`launchtriggerconditions` are validated.

* Only one Activity can be running, or **focused** at a time.

* ALAutonomousLife cycle is based on a state machine paradigm with 4 possible states:
  **Interactive**, **Solitary**, **Safeguard** and **Disabled**.
  For further details, see: :ref:`autonomouslife_states`.
