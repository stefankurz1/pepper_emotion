What it does
------------

**PackageManager** allows you to install and manage **Application Packages**.

The Package is a binary format used to  publish an :ref:`application` on the |store|.

How it works
-------------

**File format**: a package is a zipped file with .pkg extension.

**Mandatory**: the zip file must contain a manifest file.

A manifest is a XML file following a clear schema.

Getting started
---------------

The friendly way to do packages is using **Choregraphe**.
