------------

What it does
------------

ALResourceManager offers a way to manage resources. A resource can be: an
exclusive use of motor, microphone, LEDs, CPU, stiffness parameter, camera settings,
a ball...

ALResourceManager allows you to:

* avoid that another behavior uses the resources you need
* synchronize movement, LEDs, sounds...
* Run specific actions when another behavior wants your resources.
  For example, stop properly a walk before stopping a behavior that walk.


How it works
------------


Resources follow a resource hierarchy
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To see all resources and the corresponding owner, use **Choregraphe** and launch
the :ref:`chore_resource_viewer_panel`.

Taking a parent resource automatically takes all child resources.

Resource manager uses an object behavior hierarchy
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Suppose you create a behavior to play football. First, the robot should search the ball without
moving. If the robot finds the ball and needs to walk, you want to be sure that resources are
available before walking.

Resource manager allows taking a resource in a root object or root behavior,
all child objects will automatically take the resource to parent but child can
enter in conflict each others.

Free CPU
++++++++

Resource manager informs conflict without resolving the conflict, the operation
takes no-cpu. The behavior is notified and decides to reject demand or release resources.

Resource management is explicit
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Low level function call won't reserve resource and will use their own and specific
hidden resource management (a simple mutex most of the time).
If you want to manage resource (probably share behaviors), before calling a method,
you'll need to reserve resources you need and release them after call.

Resource manager allows synchronizing a group of resources
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You can reserve both head motors, text to speech and LEDs to be sure to synchronize
movements, speech and LEDs.

The group of resources is managed exactly as one resource:

* During a request, loosing one resource releases all resources.

* The timeout is the addition of all resources wait.

* Request a group cannot deadlock.


Performances and Limitations
----------------------------

**Performances**

The resource manager is free CPU.

**Limitations**

Resource allocation is explicit. If you want to resource manage a method, you need
to make an explicit call to resource manager.


Getting started
---------------

Edit resources from Choregraphe
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The easiest way to edit the resources of a box is to right click the box
and choose **Edit resources**.

For further details, see: :ref:`choregraphe-detailed-interface-box-edition-resources`.

To understand the interaction between boxes, see
the :ref:`Tutorial about the resource manager <choregraphe-tuto-resources-manager>`.

You can also play a box and check the taken resources using the
:ref:`chore_resource_viewer_panel`.


Call resource manager from python
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


.. code-block:: python

    # create proxy on resource manager
    proxy = ALProxy("ALResourceManager","localhost",9559)

    #createResource in root (parent resource is "")
    proxy.createResource("newResource","")

    #check resource is free
    free = proxy.areResourcesFree(["newResource"])

    # acquire the resource
    # acquireResource(resource name, owner name, callback to notify you that someone want the resource, timeout)
    proxy.acquireResource("newResource", "newOwner", "callback", 1)

    #release resource
    proxy.releaseResource("newResource", "newOwner")
