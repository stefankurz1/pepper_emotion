Getting Started 2 - User Data Provider Developer

------------

If you are writing a module that provides an external datasource, or otherwise
correlates data with UserSession, please read on.

Providing a data source and/or bindings to your own ID
------------------------------------------------------

| It is preferred to use UserSessions built-in getters and setters with the built-in database.
| But you may need to provide an external data source or other ID bindings if:

* You have your own database implementation that you want to be accessible
  through UserSession.
* You have a remote database, and need to provide an interface into this.
* You have a remote or local authentication system, and want this authentication
  process to be executed before your data is accessible.
* Your module is representing the user with an ID that is different than the
  integer of the UserSession ID.

The API to do this is closed for public use, and approval is required from
Aldebaran Robotics.  Please contact support for access to the API.
