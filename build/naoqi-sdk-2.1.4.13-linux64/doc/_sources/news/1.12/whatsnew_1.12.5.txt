RoboCup only
--------------

* Specific issue with **ALAudioPlayer** on RoboCup config has been solved.

Choregraphe
------------

* As some robots had experienced stability problems during Tai Chi Chuan danse,
  a new version of the **Tai Chi Chuan** box has been released.

* Read the troubleshooting section about :ref:`choregraphe-troubleshooting-connection`.
  This should solve the Bug #6467 Choregraphe / NAO connection troubles.

* **Record Sound** box. The default value of the **Microphone used** parameter has changed.

  In order to handle the main usages of this box, default value is now *Front head microphone only(.ogg)*
  instead of *Front, sides and rear head microphones (.wav)*.


Infrared / NAO web page
-------------------------

* ALInfrared can be used exclusively with devices supported by http://www.lirc.org.
  Requiring a complete overhaul, **Record a new remote** function is no longer available.
