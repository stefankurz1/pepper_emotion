Handling compile flags
=======================


.. cmake:function:: qi_sanitize_compile_flags([HIDDEN_SYMBOLS])

    :arg HIDDEN_SYMBOLS: Hide symbol in dynamic unless explicitly exported. Useful when you want to have the same behavior between ``cl.exe`` and ``gcc`` for shared libraries. Note that in this case, you should use ``qi/macro.hpp`` to export the symbols of your library.

    Sanitize compile flags between different compilers
    (gcc and cl.exe)
    The function will also read the following variables that
    can be set from the command line:
    
      * QI_WERROR:         treat warning as errors
      * QI_EFFECTIVE_CPP : emit warnings from the 'Effective C++' book
