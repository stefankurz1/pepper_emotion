    :arg SUBFOLDER: An optional subfolder in which to put the files.
    :arg IF: Condition that should be verified for the install rules to be active (for example IF WITH_ZEROMQ)
    :arg KEEP_RELATIVE_PATHS: Whether relative path should be preserved during installation.
    :arg RECURSE: Whether glob should be recursive.

.. cmake:function:: qi_install_target([<remaining args> ...] [SUBFOLDER <subfolder>] [IF <if>])

    :arg remaining args: A list of targets to install
    :arg SUBFOLDER: An optional subfolder in which to put the files.
    :arg IF: Condition that should be verified for the install rules to be active for example (IF WITH_ZEROMQ)

    install a target, that could be a program or a library.
    The destination will be: **<prefix>/lib** or **<prefix>/bin**,
    depending on the target and the platform:
    
    * Windows: ``*.dll``  and ``*.exe`` in ``bin``, ``*.lib`` in ``lib``
    * Mac:     ``.dylib`` and ``.a`` in ``lib``, executables in ``bin``
    * Linux :  ``.so``    and ``.a`` in ``lib``, executables in ``bin``
    



.. cmake:function:: qi_install_program([<remaining args> ...] [SUBFOLDER <subfolder>] [IF <if>])

    :arg remaining args: A list of programs to install
    :arg SUBFOLDER: An optional subfolder in which to put the files.
    :arg IF: Condition that should be verified for the install rules to be active for example (IF WITH_ZEROMQ)

    install program (mostly script or user provided program). Do not use this function
    to install a library or a program built by your project, prefer using :cmake:function:`qi_install_target`.
    



.. cmake:function:: qi_install_library([<remaining args> ...] [SUBFOLDER <subfolder>] [IF <if>])

    :arg remaining args: A list of libraries to install
    :arg SUBFOLDER: An optional subfolder in which to put the files.
    :arg IF: Condition that should be verified for the install rules to be active for example (IF WITH_ZEROMQ)

    install external library. Do not use this function
    to install a library or a program built by your project,
    prefer using :cmake:function:`qi_install_target`.
    



.. cmake:function:: qi_install_python([<remaining args> ...] [TARGETS <targets>] [SUBFOLDER <subfolder>] [VERSION <version>] [RECURSE] [KEEP_RELATIVE_PATHS])

    :arg remaining args: A list of files : directories and globs on files are accepted.
    :arg TARGETS: A list of targets (in the common CMake meaning).
    :arg SUBFOLDER: An optional subfolder in which to put the files.
    :arg VERSION: Could be set to "3" if you want python3 instead of python2
    :arg RECURSE: Whether glob should be recursive.
    :arg KEEP_RELATIVE_PATHS: If true, relative paths will be preserved during installation. (False by default because this is NOT the standard CMake behavior). 

    install python module.
    The destination depends on the platform and will be set with regard to it:
    
    * on Windows: *<prefix>/Lib/site-packages*
    * on Unix   : *<prefix>/lib/python<python version>/site-packages*
    
    .. note::
    
      The *python version* is automatically computed.
    
    But the user can use ``PYTHON_INSTALL_SCHEME=...`` to modify the installation layout.
    The valid values for ``PYTHON_INSTALL_SCHEME`` are:
    
    * ``NONE``  : install python modules in the default libdir instead;
    * ``DEBIAN``: install python modules in: *<LIBDIR>/python<VERSION>/dist-packages*
      (only on Linux).
