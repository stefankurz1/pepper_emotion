cmake
-----

* **Breaking change**: Remove support for disabled targets

.. code-block:: cmake

    # Old:
    qi_create_test(foo foo.cpp)
    qi_use_lib(foo BAR)

    # New:

    qi_create_test(foo foo.cpp)
    if(TARGET foo)
      qi_use_lib(foo BAR)
    endif()

    # Or:
    qi_create_test(foo foo.cpp DEPENDS BAR)



Previously ``qi_use_lib`` tried to detect when the target was
disabled (for instance because of ``-DQI_WITH_TESTS=OFF``).

This lead to hard to diagnose build failures during incremental
builds, and this functionality has been removed.
