v2.4
----

CMake
+++++

* ``qi_stage_script`` is now implemented, and it's now possible to stage Python scripts too.
* Add ``qi_generate_trampoline``
* ``qi_add_test`` now also uses ``find_program`` to find test executable.
* API break: you should now use ``BUILD_PERF_TESTS=OFF`` instead of ``BUILD_PERFS_TESTS=OFF``
  when you do not want to build the performance tests
* Fix using ``qi_add_perf_test`` on Windows when building in debug
